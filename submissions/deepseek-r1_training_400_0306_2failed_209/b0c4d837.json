        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and corresponding output grids. The goal is to find out how the input is transformed into the output. Let's look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput is a 6x6 grid. The output is 3x3. The input has a lot of 5s forming some kind of structure. The output's first row is [8,8,8], and the next two rows are all zeros. Hmm. Let's see where the 8s are in the input. In the input's fifth row (0-based index 4?), there are 8s in positions 2 and 3. And the fifth row also has 5s. Then the output's first row has three 8s. Maybe there's a connection between the 8s in the input and how they're condensed into the output.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 9x9 grid. The output is 3x3. The output has [8,8,8] in the first row, [0,0,8] in the second, and zeros otherwise. The input's rows 5,6,7 have 8s in columns 3,4,5. So maybe the output is capturing the top part of some structure made by 8s in the input. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output grids are taking specific regions from the input. Like, perhaps the output is a 3x3 section from the input. But how to determine which part?\n\nLooking at the outputs, in Example 0, the output has three 8s in the first row. The input's fifth row (index 4) has two 8s. But the output's first row has three. So maybe it's not a direct copy. Alternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are forming a kind of \"U\" shape, and the output is capturing the top part?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input form a sort of border, and the 8s are the interior. The output could be the central part of the 8s. For example, in Example 0, the input's 8s are in positions 2 and 3 of the fourth row. Wait, but the output is three 8s. Hmm. Maybe there's a layer concept. Like, the output is the top layer of the 8s structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the topmost 8s in each vertical column. For example, in Example 0's input, the first occurrence of 8 is in row 4 (if we start counting from 0). But how does that translate to the output?\n\nLooking at Example 4's input. The input is a 5x6 grid. Output is 3 rows. The output's first row is [8,0,0]. The input has 8s in rows 2 and 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the output is taking the highest occurrence of 8 in each column? Let's check. For columns 2 and 3 in input of example 4, the 8s start at row 2. The output's first row has 8 in the first position, then zeros. Maybe it's the highest 8s in the central columns? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3-row structure where each row corresponds to the presence of 8s in certain layers of the input. For instance, the highest 8s in the input form the first row of the output, then the next layers form the subsequent rows. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output dimensions. The output is always 3 rows, but the number of columns varies? Wait, no. All outputs in the examples are 3 rows with 3 columns. So the output is a 3x3 grid. The input is larger. So perhaps the output is a 3x3 section extracted from the input's central area where the 8s are present.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The 8s are in columns 3,4,5 of rows 5,6,7 (if rows start at 0). The output's first row is [8,8,8], which could correspond to those 8s in row 5. The second row is [0,0,8], maybe from row 6? But row 6 has 8s in columns 3,4,5. Wait, but output's second row is [0,0,8]. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the output is taking the leftmost, middle, and rightmost parts of the 8s structure. Or perhaps it's looking at vertical slices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by collapsing certain layers. For example, the input's 8s form a horizontal bar, and the output captures the highest three layers. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the input and output in Example 3. The input has 8s starting from row 4 (index 4) in columns 3-5. The output is [8,8,0] in the first row, then zeros. So how does that fit? Maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of 8s in each vertical column, but only for the middle three columns of the input. Wait, in Example 3's input, the 8s are in columns 3-5 (assuming 0-based). The output's first row has 8,8,0. So maybe the first two columns of the output correspond to the leftmost and middle 8s, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid that's centered on the highest 8 in the input. For example, if the highest 8 is in row X and column Y, then the output takes a 3x3 area around that. But this might not hold for all examples.\n\nAnother angle: The input seems to have a structure where 5s form a kind of border or container, and 8s are inside. The output could be related to the shape of the 8s. For example, the output represents the top part of the 8s structure.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's 8s are in a horizontal line of two 8s. The output has three 8s. That's confusing. Maybe the output is a compressed version. For instance, each row in the output corresponds to a certain layer in the input. Like, the first row of the output is the topmost layer of 8s, the second row the next, etc. But in Example 0's input, the 8s are only in one row (row 4, two 8s). The output's first row has three 8s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 8s in certain regions. For example, in Example 0, the input's 8s are two in the fourth row. But the output has three 8s. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the central three columns of the input's 8s region. For example, if the 8s form a block, the output takes the middle part. Let's check Example 1's input: the 8s are in columns 3-5 (three columns) of rows 5-7. The output's first row is all 8s. The second row is [0,0,8]. Wait, how does that fit? If we take the middle three rows and columns, maybe. But in Example 1's output, the second row has 8 in the third position. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by looking at the topmost three rows of the 8s structure. For example, in Example 1, the 8s start at row 5 (0-based) and span three rows. The output's first row is the first of those (row5), which has 8s in columns3-5. The output's first row is [8,8,8], which matches. The second row of output is [0,0,8]. Looking at row6 of input, columns3-5 are 8s, so why the output's second row has only the third column as 8? That doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by the three topmost 8s in the central vertical line. For example, if the 8s form a vertical structure, the output takes the top three. But in Example 0, the 8s are in a horizontal line. So maybe not.\n\nWait, let's look at the Test Input. It's a 9x9 grid. The input has 8s in rows 2 through 6, columns3-5. The 5s are surrounding them. The output needs to be a 3x3 grid. Let's look at the training examples for similar inputs.\n\nExample 3's input has 8s starting at row4 (0-based?), and the output is [8,8,0] in the first row, then zeros. But how? The output for example3 is 3x3. Let's see:\n\nExample3 input:\n\nRows 4,5,6,7 have 8s in columns3-5. The output's first row is [8,8,0]. Maybe the output is taking the top three rows of the 8s structure. The 8s start at row4 (input row4), so output row0 is input row4, output row1 is input row5, output row2 is input row6. For example, in example3's input, row4 (input) has 8s in columns3-5. So the first output row would be those three 8s. But the output's first row is [8,8,0]. That's different. Wait, in example3's output, the first row is [8,8,0], second and third rows are zeros. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the presence of 8s in the central vertical line. For example, in each row of the output, it's looking at the center column of the input's 8s structure. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the first three rows of the 8s structure, but rotated or transformed. For example, in example1's input, the 8s are in rows5-7. The output has three rows. Maybe the output's first row is the top row of the 8s, which has three 8s. Then the second row of the output is the next row, but maybe the left two are zeros and the third is 8. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the leftmost, middle, and rightmost columns of the 8s structure and then the first three rows. For example, if the 8s are in three columns, then each output row represents those columns. But how does that lead to the outputs seen?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to the presence of 8 in certain positions relative to the 5s. For example, the 5s form a frame, and the 8s are inside. The output is capturing the corners or edges of the 8s structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the maximum value in each quadrant. For instance, dividing the input into 3x3 regions and taking the max. But example0's input is 6x6. Divided into 3x3 regions, but the output is also 3x3. Let's check.\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRows are 6, columns 6. Divided into four 3x3 regions (but not exactly). But the output is 3x3. Maybe each output cell is the maximum of a certain area. For example, the first row of the output could take the maximum of the top-left 3x3 of the input. But example0's output's first row is all 8s, but in the input's first three rows, there are no 8s. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the center of the input. For example, taking the central 3x3 part. Let's check example0's input. The center of a 6x6 grid would be from rows 2-4 and columns 2-4. But example0's input's row4 (0-based) is [0,5,8,8,5,0]. So the center columns 2-4 would be 8,8,5. But the output's first row is [8,8,8]. That doesn't match. So probably not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the shape of the 8s as they appear in the input. For instance, the output is the top part of the 8s structure, but how?\n\nLooking at example4's input:\n\nThe input is 5 rows. The output is [8,0,0], etc. The 8s in input are in rows2 and3 (0-based), columns2 and3. The output's first row is [8,0,0]. So perhaps the output is the top row of the 8s structure, but only the leftmost 8? Or maybe the first occurrence of 8 in each column.\n\nIn example4's input, columns2 and3 have 8s starting at row2. So columns2 has 8s in rows2 and3. The output's first row is [8,0,0]. Maybe the first row of the output is the first occurrence of 8 in each of the three central columns. So for example4's input, the first 8 in column2 is row2. The first 8 in column3 is row2. Column4 (maybe central) has 5s. Wait, but example4's input is 5 rows x6 columns. The central columns might be 2 and3. So the output is taking columns2-4? Or maybe columns2 and3. But the output has three columns. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output's columns correspond to the left, middle, and right of the 8s structure. For example, the first column of the output is the leftmost column of 8s, the middle column is the center, and the third is the rightmost. Then each row of the output corresponds to the top three rows of the 8s structure.\n\nLet's see example1. The input's 8s are in columns3-5 (three columns) and rows5-7 (three rows). So the output's first row would be columns3-5 of row5, which are all 8s \u2192 [8,8,8]. The second row would be columns3-5 of row6. But row6 of input is [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0], so columns3-5 are 8,8,8. So the output's second row should be all 8s, but the actual output is [0,0,8]. That doesn't fit. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's look for another pattern. Let's compare the input and output in example1 and example3.\n\nIn example1's input, the 8s are in rows5-7, columns3-5. The output is:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo why does the second row have a single 8?\n\nWait, maybe the output is based on the diagonal of the 8s structure. For example, the first row is the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, but scaled. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of consecutive 8s in each column. For example, if a column has three 8s, the output's first row is 8, then 0s. But example1's output first row is all 8s, which would mean all three columns have three 8s. But in example1's input, each of the three columns (3-5) have three 8s. So the output's first row is three 8s. Then the second row's third column is 8. Maybe the second row is the next layer below. Wait, but how? If each column has three 8s, then the output would have three 8s in the first row and zeros elsewhere. But in example1's output, the second row's third column is 8. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the shape of the 8s structure but inverted or rotated. For example, a vertical line of 8s becomes a horizontal line in the output. But example0's 8s are horizontal, and the output's first row is horizontal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output represents the top three rows of the 8s structure, but only the leftmost three columns. For example, in example1's input, the 8s are in columns3-5. The leftmost three columns would be 3-5, but that's three columns. The output's first row is [8,8,8], which would fit. The second row of the output is [0,0,8]. Let's see the second row of the input's 8s (row6). It's [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0]. So columns3-5 are 8,8,8. If we take the first three rows of the 8s (rows5-7), each row has 8s in columns3-5. So the output should be three rows of [8,8,8], but the actual output has only the first row as such. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is capturing the \"height\" of the 8s structure. For example, the first row of the output represents the highest layer of 8s, the second row the next, etc., but only up to three rows. If the 8s structure is taller than three rows, the output's lower rows are filled with 8s. But in example1, the 8s are three rows tall (rows5-7), so the output would have three rows of [8,8,8], but the actual output has only the first row as such. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the maximum value in each of three vertical sections of the input's 8s region. For example, splitting the 8s into three parts vertically and taking the max in each. But example0's output is three 8s. The 8s in example0 are two in a row. Splitting into three parts would give two 8s and one zero. But the output is three 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is determined by the positions where 8s are surrounded by 5s. For example, the 8s that are enclosed by 5s on all sides. But example0's 8s are between 5s, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output represents the number of 8s in each row of the input's 8s structure. For example, the first row of the output is the count of 8s in the top row of the 8s structure divided by some factor. But example0's 8s are two in a row, and the output's first row is three 8s. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, looking back at example1's output. The second row is [0,0,8]. In the input's rows5-7 (8s), row5 has 8s in columns3-5. Row6 has 8s in columns3-5. Row7 has 8s in columns3-5. So why is the output's second row [0,0,8]?\n\nThis suggests that maybe the output is not directly related to the presence of 8s in the input but perhaps some other transformation. Let's think of other possibilities. For example, maybe the output is the difference between layers. Like, each output row is the difference between consecutive layers in the input. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the number of 8s in certain regions of the input. For example, each row of the output represents a horizontal slice of the input, counting the number of 8s in that slice. But example0's input has two 8s in row4, but the output's first row has three 8s, which would mean three 8s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the 5s form a container, and the 8s are inside. The output is the \"tip\" of the 8s. For example, the topmost part. Maybe the output is the first three rows of the 8s structure, but in the input, the 8s start at a certain row. Let's check example1. The 8s start at row5. So the output's first row is row5's 8s. Second row is row6's 8s, third row is row7's 8s. But row5's 8s are in columns3-5. So the first row of the output would be [8,8,8]. The second row would be [8,8,8], but the actual output has [0,0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a cell in the input's 8s region, but with certain transformations. For example, rotating or flipping. But example1's output's second row is [0,0,8], which doesn't align with the input's row6, which has three 8s.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output's structure. All outputs have 3 rows, and the first row has some 8s, while the others are mostly zeros. Maybe the output represents the \"head\" of the 8s structure. For example, the top three rows of the 8s region, but only a certain part. For example, in example1's input, the 8s are in a 3x3 block. The output's first row is all 8s, which is the top row of that block. The second row has only the rightmost 8, which could be the middle row's rightmost cell. But why? That doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the 3x3 grid that's mirrored. For example, flipping the 8s structure vertically or horizontally. But example1's output's second row is [0,0,8], which would imply that the original structure's middle row has 8 only in the last position. But the input's middle row of the 8s has three 8s.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern in the positions of the 8s in the output.\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\nExample0 output:\n[8,8,8]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nExample1 output:\n[8,8,8]\n[0,0,8]\n[0,0,0]\n\nExample2 output:\n[8,8,8]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nExample3 output:\n[8,8,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nExample4 output:\n[8,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nExample5 output:\n[8,8,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo the first row of the output varies in the number of 8s. Examples0 and 1 have three 8s, example3 and 5 have two, example4 has one, and example2 has three.\n\nLooking at the input's 8s structures:\n\nExample0's input has two 8s in a row. But output has three 8s. So how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is capturing the leftmost, middle, and rightmost 8s from the top row of the 8s structure. For example, in example0's input, the top row of 8s has two 8s. So left is 8, middle is nothing (but maybe filled as 8?), right is 8. But this would result in [8,8,8], but that's not logical. Alternatively, maybe padding with zeros. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is always three columns. If the 8s in the top row are in certain positions, then those are mapped to the output's first row. For example, if the top row of 8s has three 8s, then output's first row is all 8s. If it has two 8s, then the first two positions are 8s and the third is zero. But example3's input's top row of 8s has three 8s (row4 of input). But the output's first row is [8,8,0]. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's first row is the first three 8s encountered in the top row of the 8s structure. For example, if the top row has two 8s, then output's first row is [8,8,0]. But example0's output is [8,8,8], which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try another approach. Let's look at the positions of the 8s in the input and see how they relate to the output.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nInput's 8s are in row4 (0-based) columns2 and3. The output's first row is [8,8,8]. How does that match?\n\nMaybe the output is taking the entire row of 8s and padding with 8s or zeros to make three columns. But that doesn't fit.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nInput's 8s are in rows5-7, columns3-5 (three columns). Output's first row is [8,8,8], which matches. The second row is [0,0,8]. If we look at row6 of the input, columns3-5 are 8,8,8. So why is the output's second row [0,0,8]?\n\nWait, maybe the output is not just the 8s but also considering surrounding 5s. Like, the output represents how the 8s are enclosed by 5s. For example, the output's first row is the top layer of 8s. The next rows indicate if there are 5s adjacent below. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid that represents the upper part of the 8s structure, with each cell in the output corresponding to a cell in the input's structure. But how?\n\nLet me think about the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nIt's a 9x9 grid. The 8s are in rows2-6, columns3-5. The 5s are surrounding them. The output needs to be 3x3.\n\nLooking at similar examples. Example1's input has 8s in rows5-7, columns3-5. Output's first row is [8,8,8], second [0,0,8], third [0,0,0].\n\nExample3's input has 8s starting at row4. Output's first row is [8,8,0].\n\nWait, maybe the number of layers of 8s affects the output. For example, in the Test Input, the 8s are in rows2-6 (5 rows). Example1's 8s are 3 rows. The output for example1's first row is all 8s, and the second row has a single 8. So perhaps when there are multiple layers of 8s, the output's second row captures the continuation. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output's first row is the top layer of 8s. The second row is the number of 8s in the middle layers, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: The output's rows represent the first three rows of the 8s structure. The columns in the output are the left, center, and right of the 8s structure. So for example, if the 8s structure is a vertical block, the left column would be the leftmost 8 in each row, center the middle, and right the rightmost.\n\nLet's check Example1's input:\n\nRows5-7, columns3-5 are all 8s. So for each row, left is column3, center column4, right column5. So the output's first row (top row of 8s) would be [8,8,8]. The second row (next row) would be [8,8,8]. But the actual output's second row is [0,0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's second row is the bottom row of the 8s structure. For example, in Example1, the 8s end at row7. So the output's second row is the last row of the 8s. But row7 has three 8s, so why output's second row is [0,0,8]?\n\nThis is really puzzling. Let me try to find another pattern. Let's look for the position of the 8s in the input relative to the 5s.\n\nIn Example0's input, the 8s are between two 5s in the same row. The 5s form a U-shape. The output captures the top of the U.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the top three cells of the '8' structure, arranged vertically. For example, in Example0's input, the 8s are in a horizontal line. The output's first row is all 8s, but the next rows are zeros. So perhaps it's the top of a horizontal line.\n\nIn Example1, the 8s form a vertical column. The output's first row is all 8s (top of the column), second row has a single 8 (middle?), third row zero. But example1's output's second row is [0,0,8], which could be the bottom of the vertical column. But why?\n\nAnother observation: the outputs have a varying number of 8s in the first row. It seems that when the 8s structure is wider, the first row has more 8s. For example, in Example0, the 8s are two in a row, but the output's first row has three. So that doesn't directly match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid that represents the upper-left, upper-middle, and upper-right of the 8s structure, regardless of the actual positions. For example, in a wide 8s structure, the first row of the output is filled with 8s. If the structure is narrow, it's partially filled.\n\nBut this is vague. Let's think about the Test Input. The 8s are in columns3-5 (three columns) and rows2-6 (five rows). So it's a vertical block of 8s. What would be the output based on previous examples?\n\nLooking at Example1, which has a vertical block of 3 rows of 8s. Output's first row is all 8s, second row has a single 8 in the third column. The Test Input's 8s are five rows tall. So maybe the output's first row is all 8s, the second row has a single 8 in the third column, and the third row zeros. But in example3, which has four rows of 8s, the output's first row is [8,8,0], and the rest are zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by how many layers of 8s are present. For example, if there are three or more layers, the first row is [8,8,8], the second row is [0,0,8], else only some positions. But example3 has four layers and the output's first row is [8,8,0], which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by looking at the first three rows of the 8s structure. For the Test Input, the first three rows of 8s are rows2,3,4. Each of these rows has three 8s (columns3-5). So the output's first three rows would each be [8,8,8]. But according to previous examples, this doesn't fit. For instance, Example1's output has [8,8,8] and then [0,0,8], but the Test Input's output would be three rows of [8,8,8], which isn't seen in the examples.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the outputs, the number of 8s in the first row varies. Maybe the first row's 8s correspond to the number of columns in the 8s structure. For example, if the 8s structure is three columns wide, the first row is three 8s. If two columns, two 8s and a zero. But example0's output has three 8s even though the structure is two columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output's first row is the number of 8s in the top row of the structure, but mapped to the first three columns. For example, if the top row has two 8s, the first two positions are 8s, third is zero. But example0's output is three 8s. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first three elements of the top row of the 8s structure. For example, if the top row has three 8s, the first row of the output is [8,8,8]. If the top row has two 8s, the first two elements are 8s and the third is zero. But example0's top row of 8s has two 8s, but the output's first row is three 8s. So this is not matching.\n\nThis is really tough. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid that represents the positions where the 8s are connected to the 5s. For example, the output's cells are 8 if there's a 5 adjacent in a certain direction. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of some mathematical operation on the 8s positions. Like, the sum or product of their coordinates modulo something. But I don't see how that would produce the outputs.\n\nAnother idea: The output's rows correspond to the first three rows of the input's 8s structure, and each column corresponds to the leftmost, middle, and rightmost 8 in each of those rows. For example:\n\nIn example1's input's row5 (top of 8s), columns3-5 are 8s. So left is 3, middle 4, right 5. So the output's first row is [8,8,8].\n\nRow6 has columns3-5 as 8s. So left 3 is 8, middle4 is 8, right5 is 8. But the output's second row is [0,0,8]. This doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's columns are the left, center, and right of the entire 8s structure. For example, in example1's input, the 8s are in columns3-5. Left is column3, center column4, right column5. So for each row in the output, it's checking if the corresponding row in the input's 8s structure has 8s in those columns.\n\nRow5: all three columns have 8s \u2192 [8,8,8].\n\nRow6: all three have 8s \u2192 [8,8,8], but the output is [0,0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's first row is the top row of the 8s structure, the second row is the row below, and the third row is the row after that. But each row in the output is the leftmost, middle, and rightmost 8 of that row.\n\nFor example, in example1's input:\n\nRow5 (8s in columns3-5): left, middle, right \u2192 [8,8,8].\n\nRow6 (8s in columns3-5): left, middle, right \u2192 [8,8,8].\n\nRow7 (8s in columns3-5): [8,8,8].\n\nBut the output's second row is [0,0,8], which doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Let's look at example3's output. The first row is [8,8,0]. The input's 8s start at row4, columns3-5. So the first row of the output would be [8,8,8]. But the actual output is [8,8,0]. This suggests that the rightmost 8 is not considered. Why?\n\nMaybe the output's columns are determined by the presence of 5s surrounding the 8s. For example, in example3's input, the 8s in row4 are columns3-5. To the right of column5 is a 5. Maybe the output's third column is zero because there's a 5 adjacent. But example3's input row4 is [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0]. So columns3-5 are 8s. The 5s are in columns2 and6. So the 8s are between 5s. The output's first row is [8,8,0]. Maybe the third column is zero because there's a 5 to the right of the 8s. But this doesn't explain why it's zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's columns are determined by the columns of the 5s. For example, the 5s form a boundary, and the output's columns are the positions between them. But example3's input's 5s are in columns2 and6. The 8s are in columns3-5. So three columns. The output's first row has three 8s. But in example3's output, it's [8,8,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me try to find a commonality in the outputs. All outputs have 3 rows, and the first row has varying numbers of 8s, while the other rows are mostly zeros except example1's second row.\n\nLooking at example1's output:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThis suggests that the 8s in the input's 8s structure have a certain pattern that the output is capturing. Maybe the output is a kind of \"arrow\" pointing in a certain direction. For example, the first row is the head, and the second row is the tail. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of a flood fill algorithm starting from the top of the 8s structure, but stopping after three steps. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the result of taking the top three 8s in the central column of the input's 8s structure. For example, the central column is where the 8s are most numerous. For example1's input, the central column is column4, which has three 8s. So the output's first row is 8 (top), second 8 (middle), third 8 (bottom). But the output's first row is three 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output's first row is the count of 8s in the top layer of the 8s structure, then the next layers. But example0's first row has three 8s, but the top layer has two.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me think about the Test Input again and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest Input's 8s are in rows2-6, columns3-5. The output needs to be 3x3. Looking at the training examples, example1's input has 8s in rows5-7, columns3-5, and the output is three 8s in the first row, then [0,0,8]. Maybe the output is capturing the height of the 8s structure. For example, if the structure is taller than three rows, the second row's third column is an 8. So for the Test Input's 5 rows of 8s, perhaps the output's first row is three 8s, second row's third column is 8, and third row's third column is 8. But according to example1, which has three rows of 8s, the output's second row is [0,0,8], and the third row is all zeros. So maybe the number of rows in the 8s structure affects how many 8s are in the output's subsequent rows.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf the 8s structure has 3 rows: output first row all 8s, second row third column 8, third row zero.\n\nIf it has 4 rows: output first row all 8s, second row third column 8, third row third column 8.\n\nBut the Test Input has 5 rows. So output would have three 8s in the first row, then two more in the third column for the next two rows. But the output is 3x3, so maybe the third row would also have a 8 in the third column. But according to example1, which has three rows of 8s, the output's third row is all zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output's second row's third column is 8 if the 8s structure is three rows tall, and zeros otherwise. But example3's input has four rows of 8s, and the output's second row is zeros.\n\nThis is not leading me anywhere. Let me try to look for another pattern.\n\nIn example4's output, the first row is [8,0,0]. The input's 8s are in two rows, columns2 and3. So the output's first row is [8,0,0]. Maybe the first column of the output corresponds to the leftmost 8 in the top row of the 8s structure. The second column to the middle, and third to the right. So in example4's input, the top row of 8s (row2) has 8s in columns2 and3. The leftmost is column2, middle column3, right nothing. So output's first row is [8,8,0], but actual output is [8,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output's columns are the left, center, and right of the entire 8s structure. For example, the leftmost column of the 8s structure, the central column, and the rightmost column. Then each row of the output represents whether there's an 8 in that position of the structure.\n\nFor example, in example1's input:\n\nLeftmost column of 8s is column3, center column4, right column5. The 8s structure has three rows (rows5-7). So the first row of the output (top row) would be 8 in all three columns. The second row (next layer) would also be 8 in all three. But the output's second row is [0,0,8], which doesn't match.\n\nThis is really perplexing. I think I need to look for a different approach. Maybe the output is the result of some kind of image processing kernel or convolution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 matrix representing the top three rows of the 8s structure, but shifted in some way. For example, if the 8s start at a certain row, the output is those rows shifted left or right.\n\nFor example, in example0's input, the 8s are in row4. The output's first row is three 8s. The input's row4 is [0,5,8,8,5,0]. The 8s are at positions2 and3. So the output's first row is three 8s, which may be taking positions2-4 (which are 8,8,5), but that doesn't fit. So perhaps not.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs always have three rows, and each row has three elements. The input's size varies but is larger than 3x3. So the output is a compressed version of the input's 8s structure.\n\nPerhaps the output is created by taking the average or sum of certain regions. For example, each output cell represents a 2x2 region of the input. But this would require the input to be divisible into such regions, which may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid that's centered on the centroid of the 8s structure. For example, finding the center of the 8s and taking a 3x3 around it. Let's check example0's input. The 8s are in row4, columns2 and3. The centroid would be at column2.5. So the 3x3 grid around that would include columns2-4 and rows3-5. But row4's columns2-4 are 8,8,5. So the output would be a 3x3 grid including these values, but the example0's output is [8,8,8], which doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to think of the output as a kind of code, where the 8s represent certain features. For example, the number of 8s in the output's first row indicates the width of the 8s structure, and the subsequent rows indicate depth. But example0's output has three 8s even though the width is two.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows represent the presence of 8s in three vertical lines. For example, left, middle, right. If the 8s structure has a certain width, then those vertical lines are present.\n\nFor example, in example0's input, the 8s are two columns wide. So the output's first row has two 8s and one zero. But the output is three 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the positions of the 5s and how they relate to the output. For example, the 5s form a kind of container, and the output is based on the shape of that container.\n\nIn example0's input, the 5s form a U-shape. The output is three 8s. Maybe the number of 5s in certain positions affects the output. But I can't see a direct correlation.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first row has as many 8s as the number of 5s in the first row of the input. But example0's input's first row has six zeros, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output's rows correspond to certain rows in the input. For example, the first row of the output is the input's row where the first occurrence of 8 happens. The second row of the output is the next row, etc.\n\nIn example0's input, the first 8 is in row4. So the output's first row is row4's 8s. But row4 has two 8s. The output's first row has three 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are the three rows from the input where the 8s start. For example, if the 8s start at rowx, then output row0 is rowx, row1 is rowx+1, row2 is rowx+2. But example0's output has three rows, but the input's 8s are in one row. So this isn't possible.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let's try to summarize what I've noticed:\n\n- The output is a 3x3 grid.\n\n- The first row often has some 8s, the other rows mostly zeros.\n\n- The number of 8s in the first row varies.\n\n- The 8s in the input are enclosed by 5s, forming a container.\n\n- The output's first row seems to correspond to the top row of the 8s structure, but sometimes with extra 8s.\n\n- In example1, the output's second row has a single 8 in the third column, which might indicate the bottom of the 8s structure.\n\nGiven the Test Input has 8s in rows2-6 (five rows), columns3-5 (three columns), and the 5s form a container around them. Based on the examples, the output is likely to have the first row as [8,8,8], the second row with a single 8 in the third column, and the third row zeros. But looking at example1, which has three rows of 8s, the output's second row is [0,0,8]. For the Test Input, which has five rows of 8s, perhaps the output's second row would also have [0,0,8], but maybe more. But example1's output for three rows of 8s has only one 8 in the second row. So the Test Input's output might be similar to example1's but with more 8s in the second or third rows. But example3's input has four rows of 8s and the output's first row is [8,8,0], with the rest zeros. So this pattern isn't consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's first row is all 8s if the 8s structure has three or more columns, and fewer otherwise. Example0's output has three 8s even though it's two columns. So that's not it.\n\nI'm not making progress. Let's look for a different approach. Perhaps the output is the first three 8s encountered in a specific order. For example, left to right, top to bottom. So the first three 8s in the input form the first row of the output.\n\nIn example0's input, the 8s are two in a row. But the output's first row is three 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of 8s in specific vertical layers. For example, the first layer (top) has two 8s, so output's first row is two 8s. But example0's output is three 8s.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's structure: 8s are in rows2-6, columns3-5. It's similar to example1 but with more rows. Example1's output is:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe Test Input's 8s are more rows, but maybe the output is the same as example1's. Alternatively, since the Test Input has more rows, the output's second row might have another 8. But looking at example3, which has more rows of 8s, the output's first row is [8,8,0], which doesn't follow. So I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: example3's output has [8,8,0], which might correspond to the top row of the 8s structure being three 8s, but the third column is zero. Maybe because the third column's 8 is not as deep. But I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, the output is determined by the number of 5s surrounding the 8s. For example, if an 8 has 5s on both sides in the same row, it's counted in the output.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll go with the pattern observed in example1 and example3. For the Test Input, which has 5 rows of 8s, the output is likely:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut example3's input has four rows of 8s and the output is [8,8,0]. So perhaps the Test Input's output is:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the Test Input's 8s are in rows2-6 (five rows), columns3-5. The top three rows of the 8s (rows2-4) are three rows. So the output's first three rows would be [8,8,8] each, but according to example1, only the first row is [8,8,8], and the second row is [0,0,8]. So maybe the output is:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThis matches example1's pattern, even though the Test Input has more rows. So I'll go with that.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers, and the output is a smaller grid. The task is to determine how the input is transformed into the output.\n\nLet me start by examining Example 0. The input grid is 6x6. The output is a 3x3 grid. The first row of the output is [8,8,8], and the next two rows are all zeros. Looking at the input grid for Example 0, the bottom part has a row with 5,8,8,8,5,0. Then the next row is 5s and 5s. The 8s in the input might be forming some shape. Maybe the output captures the topmost 8s? Or perhaps the 8s in a certain position?\n\nLooking at the input of Example 0, the 8s are in the fourth and fifth rows. The output's first row is three 8s. Let me check the positions. In the input's fourth row, the 8s are at positions 2 and 3 (assuming 0-based index). Wait, maybe the output is capturing the vertical segments of 8s. Wait, the input for Example 0's fifth row (row index 4) has 8,8 in the third and fourth positions. Then the output is three 8s. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input is a 9x9 grid. The output is [8,8,8], [0,0,8], [0,0,0]. The input's fifth row (index 5) has 5 followed by 8,8,8. Then rows 6 and 7 also have 8,8,8. The output's first row is three 8s, the second row has two zeros and an 8. Maybe the output is taking the top layer of 8s? But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid is the central part of the 8s structure. For example, in Example 0, the 8s form a horizontal line of two 8s, but the output is three 8s. That doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe the output is capturing the maximum values in certain regions. But Example 0's output has all 8s in the first row. Let's see another approach.\n\nAnother idea: the output grids have three rows. Looking at the inputs, maybe each row in the output corresponds to a vertical slice from the input. For instance, the input's middle columns could be extracted. Let's check the inputs and outputs.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 8s are in positions (4,2) and (4,3). The output is three rows, each with three elements. Maybe the output is taking a 3x3 section from the input. But where? The output's first row is all 8s. Looking at the input's rows, the fourth row (index 4) has 8s in columns 2 and 3. The fifth row (index 5) has 5s except for the third and fourth columns. Wait, maybe the output is capturing the part of the input where 8s are surrounded by 5s. Like the 8s form a sort of enclosure, and the output is the area inside that enclosure?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of 8s in certain regions. But the outputs are numbers, not counts. Wait, the outputs have 8s and 0s, which are the same as the input's values.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a transformed version where the 8s form a certain shape. Let's consider the structure of the input grids. In all examples, the input grids have a layer of 5s surrounding 8s. The 8s form a rectangle or a block. Then the output seems to represent a portion of those 8s. Maybe the output is the central part of the 8s structure, but cropped.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's input, the 8s are in rows 5-7 (0-based?) columns 3-5. The output is 3x3, with the first row all 8s, the second row two 0s and an 8. Wait, but how does that relate? The input's 8s in those rows are three 8s in each row. So the output's first row would be [8,8,8], and the next rows... Maybe the output is taking the top three rows of the 8s block. But in Example 1's output, the second row is [0,0,8], which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a view of the 8s as if you're looking from above, removing the 5s. But how?\n\nWait, looking at Example 3. The input has 8s in rows 4-7 (if 0-based), columns 3-5. The output is [8,8,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]. So perhaps the output is capturing the topmost row of 8s, but only the leftmost three? Or maybe there's a pattern in how the 8s are arranged vertically.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the input and output dimensions. For Example 0, input is 6x6, output is 3x3. Example 1: 9x9 input, 3x3 output. Example 2: 9x9 input, 3x3 output. So the output is always 3x3 regardless of input size. So the transformation reduces the grid to 3x3.\n\nNow, how? Let's look for a pattern in the 3x3 outputs. For Example 0, the output is three 8s followed by zeros. For Example 1, first row all 8s, second row two zeros and an 8, third row zeros. Example 2's output is the same as Example 0. Example 3's output starts with [8,8,0], then zeros. Example 4's output has [8,0,0], then zeros. Example 5's output is [8,8,0], zeros.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is a 9x9 grid. The 8s are present in rows 2-7 (0-based) in columns 3-5. Let's see.\n\nWait, the test input:\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]\n\nRow 3-7: same as row 2, but the last row (8) is [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0].\n\nSo the 8s form a vertical block from row 2 to row 7 (indices 2 to 7, inclusive?), columns 3-5 (indices 3,4,5). So that's a vertical rectangle of 6 rows high and 3 columns wide. The output needs to be a 3x3 grid. How to map this?\n\nLooking at the training examples. Example 1's input has 8s in rows 5-7 (three rows), columns 3-5. The output is:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nSo the first row of the output is all 8s, the second row has 8 in the third position. Hmm. Maybe the output is taking the top three rows of the 8s structure, but then only certain parts. Wait, Example 1's input has three rows of 8s (rows 5,6,7). The output's first row is those three 8s (from row 5), the second row has 8 in the third position. Maybe it's looking at the layers of the 8s structure. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are in a vertical stack. The output's first row is the topmost layer (all 8s), then the next layers may have some zeros where the 5s are? Or perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the middle three columns of the input and then taking the first three rows that contain 8s, but that doesn't fit all examples. For instance, Example 0 has 8s in row 4 (the fifth row), and the output is [8,8,8], which would correspond to that row. But then the next rows are zeros. Wait, perhaps each row in the output corresponds to a certain layer in the input's 8 structure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the central 3x3 area of the input's 8s. But in Example 1, the 8s are in a 3x3 area (rows 5-7, columns 3-5). The central 3x3 would be exactly that, but the output is [8,8,8] in the first row. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: let's look at the output and see how it's formed. For Example 1, the output has 8s in the first row, and in the third column of the second row. Looking at the input's structure, the 8s are in columns 3-5, rows 5-7. So the first row of the output (3x3) might correspond to the first layer (row 5) of the 8s. The second row of the output might be looking at row 6 of the input's 8s. But in row 6, columns 3-5 are 8s. The output's second row is [0,0,8], which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a slice of the 8s structure, but with some transformation. Like, taking the top, middle, and bottom parts. For Example 1, the 8s are in rows 5,6,7. Taking the first, third, and fifth layers (but there are only three layers). Maybe the output's rows are the first, middle, and last of the 8s. For Example 1, the three 8 rows are 5,6,7. So first row (5) is all 8s. Middle row (6) is 8s. Last row (7) is 8s. But the output's first row is [8,8,8], the second [0,0,8], third [0,0,0]. That doesn't align. So that's not it.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's output: [8,8,0], then zeros. The input has the 8s starting from row 4 (0-based). Let's count the input rows. The input for Example 3 is 9 rows. The 8s are in rows 4-7 (indices 4,5,6,7). So four rows of 8s. The output's first row is [8,8,0]. Maybe the output is taking the first three rows of the 8s and then some columns. Wait, the input's 8s in columns 3-5 (three columns). So if there are four rows of 8s, perhaps the output's three rows are the first three rows of the 8s structure. For Example 3, the output's first row is the first row of 8s (row 4), which has 8,8,8. But the output's first row is [8,8,0]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the difference between adjacent layers. For example, comparing each row to the one below. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the 5s and 8s. The 5s form a kind of border around the 8s. The output may be the \"interior\" of the 8s structure. But how would that work?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to the number of 8s in certain positions. For example, each output cell is the sum of 8s in a specific region. But in Example 0's output, the first row has three 8s, which sum to 24. But the output is 8s, not sums. So that's probably not.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a specific section of the 8s. For instance, the top-left 3x3 section. Let's check Example 0. The input's 8s are in positions (4,2) and (4,3). But that's two columns. How would that form a 3x3 output? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the central three columns of the input and then the rows where 8s start to appear. For example, in Example 0, the input has 6 columns. The central three would be columns 2-4. The first row of the output is [8,8,8], which might be row 4 of the input, columns 2-4. But row 4 is [0,5,8,8,5,0], so columns 2 and 3 are 8,8. Columns 2-4 would be 8,8,5. Then the output first row would be [8,8,5], but the actual output is [8,8,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think of another angle. The output is always a 3x3 grid. All the outputs have 8s and 0s. Maybe each cell in the output corresponds to whether there's an 8 in a certain position relative to the 5s' structure.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input's 5s form two vertical lines on columns 2 and 6. The 8s are between these columns. The output's first row is all 8s, which corresponds to the top of the 8s' block. The second row has an 8 in the third column. Maybe this is the first row where the 5s start to close in again. For example, in row 5, the 8s are in columns 3-5. But in row 6, maybe there's a 5 in column 5. Wait, the input's row 5 is [0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]. So columns 3-5 are 8s. So rows 5-7 all have 8s in columns 3-5. The output's first row is [8,8,8], then the second row is [0,0,8]. Wait, perhaps the output's rows are the top three rows of the 8s, but only looking at the leftmost three columns. No, because columns 3-5 are all 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's rows are the top three rows of the 8s block, but each row in the output is a horizontal slice. For example, in Example 1, the 8s start at row 5. The output's first row is the first row of the 8s (row 5: 8,8,8), the second row is row 6 (8,8,8), but the output is [0,0,8]. That doesn't align.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output: first row [8,8,8], second [0,0,8], third zeros. Maybe the first row is the first layer of 8s, the second row is the next layer but only the last element is 8. How does that relate to the input? The input's rows 5-7 all have 8s in columns 3-5. So why does the second output row have only one 8?\n\nPerhaps the output is not directly the 8s' structure but some transformation based on the surrounding 5s. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are surrounded by 5s on columns 2 and 6. The output might represent the intersection or the path through the 5s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a maze, where 0 is empty, 5 is a wall, and 8 is a path. The output could represent the exit path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output's rows correspond to the levels of the 8s. For example, the first row of the output is the top level of the 8s, then each subsequent row checks if there's a 8 below. But the output rows have zeros where there's no 8. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a kind of erosion or dilation of the 8s. For example, each row in the output is a row in the input's 8s structure, but shifted or modified based on neighboring elements.\n\nWait, looking at Example 4's input. The input is 5 rows. The 8s are in rows 2 and 3 (indices 2 and 3) in columns 2 and 3. The output is [8,0,0], then zeros. So the output's first row is 8 followed by zeros. Maybe the output captures the leftmost 8 in each row of the 8s structure. But in Example 4's input, rows 2 and 3 have 8s in columns 2 and 3. So the leftmost 8s are in column 2. The output's first row is [8,0,0]. So maybe the first element is 8, others are 0. But how does this generalize?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first occurrence of an 8 in each row and then filling the output's row. But Example 0's first output row is all 8s, which suggests that each position in the output's row is filled with 8 if there's an 8 in the corresponding position of the input's row. But in Example 0, the input's row 4 (the one with 8s) has 8s in positions 2 and 3. But the output's first row is three 8s. That doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a diagonal from the input's 8s structure. For example, the first row of the output is the first three 8s in the first layer, then the next rows are shifted. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking for the positions where 8s are adjacent to 5s. For example, in the input, an 8 that is next to a 5 (either horizontally or vertically) contributes to the output. Let's check Example 0. The 8s in row 4 are surrounded by 5s on the left and right. So maybe those edges contribute to the output. But how that translates to the output's 8,8,8 is unclear.\n\nWait, let's think of the input as a 2D structure where 5s form a kind of container, and the 8s fill it. The output could represent the layers of this container as you go down. For example, the top layer is all 8s (since the container is widest at the top), and as you go down, the container narrows, leading to fewer 8s in the output's lower rows.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output: the first row is all 8s, the second has an 8 in the third column, and the third row is zeros. So perhaps the container narrows. In the input, the 5s form a V-shape, so the 8s are in a column that gets narrower. But how does this happen in the input? In Example 1's input, the 5s are in columns 2 and 6 for all rows. The 8s are between them, so it's a vertical strip. But why does the output's second row have only one 8?\n\nMaybe the output is capturing the overlap between the 8s and certain rows. For example, the first row of the output corresponds to the first occurrence of three 8s in a row. Then the next rows are the subsequent rows, but any deviation (like a 5 appearing) turns to zero. For example, in Example 1's input, the first three rows with 8s (rows 5,6,7) all have three 8s. But the output's second row is [0,0,8]. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's rows are based on the middle three rows of the input's 8s structure. For example, if the 8s span six rows (like the test input), then taking the middle three rows. But how to determine which rows are selected.\n\nThe test input's 8s are in rows 2-7 (assuming 0-based). So six rows. The middle three would be rows 3,4,5. So the output's three rows would be these. Each row has 8s in columns 3-5. So the output would be three rows of [8,8,8]. But the training examples don't all align with that. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are in three rows (5-7), so the middle row is 6. But the output's second row is [0,0,8]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the 8s structure. For the test input, which has six rows of 8s, the first three would be rows 2,3,4. Each of these rows has 8s in columns 3-5. So the output would be three rows of [8,8,8]. But in Example 3's input, the 8s are in four rows (rows 4-7). Taking the first three would be rows 4,5,6, which each have three 8s. So the output would be three rows of [8,8,8], but Example 3's output is [8,8,0], then zeros. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try a different approach. Let's look for a pattern in the outputs. All outputs have 8s only in the first row or first and second rows. The 8s are in varying positions. For example:\n\n- Example 0: [8,8,8], then zeros.\n\n- Example 1: [8,8,8], [0,0,8], then zeros.\n\n- Example 3: [8,8,0], then zeros.\n\n- Example 4: [8,0,0], then zeros.\n\nSo the first row of the output seems to capture the leftmost or some part of the 8s' structure, and subsequent rows have fewer 8s. Maybe the output is a projection of the 8s' structure from the top, but only capturing the 'highest' 8s in each column.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the number of layers of 8s in each column. For example, if a column has three layers of 8s, the first row would have 8, the second 8, the third 8. If it has two layers, maybe the first row is 8, the second 8, third 0. But looking at Example 0's input, the 8s are in two columns (columns 2 and 3) and in one row (row 4). So each column has one layer. But the output's first row is three 8s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output represents the presence of 8s in the vertical slices. For example, each column in the output represents the presence of 8s in certain positions vertically. For example, the first column of the output is the first occurrence of an 8 in the first vertical slice of the input's 8s structure. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell (i,j) represents whether the input cell at (i + offset_x, j + offset_y) is an 8. The offset would be determined based on the input structure. But how to find the offset.\n\nLooking at Example 0: the input is 6x6. The output is 3x3. The 8s are in row 4 (index 4), columns 2 and 3. The output's first row is [8,8,8]. So maybe the offset is 4 - 0 = 4 rows? But that would mean taking row 4, columns 2,3,4. But row 4 of input is [0,5,8,8,5,0]. Columns 2-4 are 8,8,5. So output row 0 is [8,8,5], but the actual output is [8,8,8]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the central 3 columns and central 3 rows of the input. For Example 0: input is 6x6. Central rows would be 2,3,4. Central columns 2,3,4. Let's see:\n\nRow 2: [0,5,0,0,5,0] \u2192 columns 2-4 are 0,0,5 \u2192 row in output would be 0,0,5 \u2192 not matching.\n\nNo, that doesn't work.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is formed by collapsing the input's structure. For instance, each row in the output is a maximum or sum of certain rows in the input. For Example 0, the output's first row could be the maximum of the input's rows 3-5. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of a convolution or some filter applied to the input. For example, a 3x3 kernel that detects certain patterns. But without knowing the kernel, this is hard.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output:\n\nFirst row: [8,8,8]\n\nSecond row: [0,0,8]\n\nThird: zeros.\n\nIn the input, the 8s are in columns 3-5, rows 5-7. The output's first row is all 8s (columns 3-5). Second row has 8 in column 5. So maybe it's looking at how the 5s are positioned around the 8s. For example, in row 6 of the input (which is part of the 8s block), the columns 3-5 are 8s. But why does the output's second row have an 8 only in the third column? That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a reflection of how the 5s are arranged. For instance, the 5s form two vertical lines, and the output is capturing the space between them. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the output's rows correspond to the number of 5s adjacent to the 8s in each layer. For example, the first row of the output has 8s where there are 5s above, below, left, or right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of subtracting the 5s' positions from the 8s' positions in some way. This is vague.\n\nMaybe I need to look for a different pattern. Let's compare the input and output of each example:\n\nExample 0:\nInput's 8s are in row 4 (0,5,8,8,5,0). Output's first row is [8,8,8]. So perhaps the output is the three 8s in the middle of the input's row. Wait, but in row 4, the 8s are two in number. How does that become three 8s in the output?\n\nAh, wait. Maybe the output is not taken directly from the input's rows but from a diagonal. For instance, in Example 0's input, the 8s form a horizontal line of two 8s. The output's first row has three 8s, which could be a diagonal from the 8s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a zoomed-in view of the area around the 8s. But how?\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output is formed by taking the columns where the 5s form boundaries. For example, the 5s are on the left and right of the 8s. The output's columns might correspond to these boundaries. But Example 0's output has three columns of 8s, but the input's 8s are between two 5s. So why three columns in the output?\n\nWait, perhaps the output's columns are the leftmost, middle, and rightmost columns of the 8s' block. For example, in Example 0's input, the 8s are in two columns. But the output has three columns. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output's columns represent the start, middle, and end of the 8s' block. For example, in Example 1's input, the 8s are in columns 3-5 (three columns). So the output's three columns correspond to those three. The first row is all 8s. The second row's third column is 8, meaning that in the second layer (row 6 of the input), the third column (5th column of input) has a 5. But no, in row 6, columns 3-5 are 8s.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for the number of 8s in the input and the output. For Example 0, there are two 8s in the input, but the output has three 8s. So it's not a direct count. For Example 1, the input has 3 rows \u00d73 columns of 8s =9 8s. Output has 4 8s. So that's not a direct count either.\n\nAnother idea: the output represents the depth of the 8s structure. For example, each row in the output corresponds to a layer in the 8s' block. If the block has more layers, the output's rows would have 8s. For example, in the test input, the 8s are in six rows. So the output's three rows would all have 8s. But looking at Example 1, which has three layers of 8s, the output's first row is all 8s, second row has one 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the first three layers of the 8s' block, but each layer is shifted. For example, the first row of the output is the first layer, the second row is the second layer shifted left or right, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first three 8s in each row of the input. But in Example 0's input, the first row with 8s (row 4) has two 8s. The output's first row has three 8s. So that's not possible.\n\nMaybe the output is the result of some kind of run-length encoding or pattern matching. For example, the output captures the maximum consecutive 8s in each row of the input. But Example 0's input row 4 has two 8s. The output's first row is three 8s, so that's not matching.\n\nThis is frustrating. Let's try to look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern based on the training examples.\n\nTest input:\n\nRows 2-7 (0-based) have 8s in columns 3-5. So six rows of three 8s each. The output is expected to be 3x3. Looking at Example 2, which has eight rows of 8s (rows 5-7, which are three rows?), the output is [8,8,8], then zeros. But the test input has six rows. Example 1 has three rows of 8s, output has first row all 8s, second row has one 8. So perhaps the number of rows with 8s determines the output.\n\nTest input has six rows of 8s. What's the output for six layers? Maybe the output's first row is all 8s, second row all 8s, third row all 8s. But none of the training examples have three rows of 8s. Example 0 has output with one row of 8s. Example 1 has two rows with 8s. Example 2 has one row. Example 3 has one row. Example 4 has one row. Example 5 has one row.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output's first row is all 8s, second row has one 8. The input has three rows of 8s. So perhaps the output's rows are based on the number of layers. For three layers, the first row is all 8s, the second has one 8, third is zero.\n\nIf the test input has six layers of 8s, perhaps the output would have all three rows with 8s. But none of the training examples have that. Alternatively, the output is always three rows, with each row corresponding to how many layers are there modulo something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first, middle, and last layers of the 8s. For example, if there are six layers, the first layer (row 2), the third layer (row 4), and the sixth layer (row 7). Each of these layers has three 8s. So the output would be three rows of [8,8,8]. But none of the training examples have this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first three rows of the 8s structure. So for the test input's six layers, the first three are rows 2,3,4. Each has three 8s. So the output would be three rows of [8,8,8]. But looking at Example 1, which has three layers, the output's first row is [8,8,8], second row [0,0,8]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother observation: in the training examples, the output's first row has as many 8s as the number of columns in the 8s' block. For example, Example 0 has two 8s in the input's row, but the output's first row is three 8s. No, that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first row has 8s for each column that has at least one 8 in any row of the input. For example, in the test input, columns 3-5 have 8s in all six rows. So the output's first row would be [8,8,8]. But how do the subsequent rows get filled?\n\nThis is taking too long, and I need to find a pattern. Let's look for the position of the 5s. In Example 0's input, the 5s are in columns 1 and 4. The 8s are between them. The output is [8,8,8], which could be the three columns between the 5s. Wait, columns 1 and 4 are the 5s. So the 8s are in columns 2 and 3. But how does that become three columns? Unless there's a middle column with 5 that's not visible. No.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 5s are in columns 2 and 6. The 8s are in columns 3-5. So three columns between the 5s. The output's first row has three 8s. So maybe the output's columns correspond to the columns between the 5s. So in general, if the 5s are in columns x and y, then the columns between x+1 and y-1 are the 8s. The output's columns are those in between. So for Example 1, between columns 2 and 6: columns 3-5. Three columns. So the output's columns are three. That makes sense. Each row of the output corresponds to a row in the input's 8s structure. But the rows in the output are three, so perhaps the first three rows of the 8s structure.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input's 8s start at row 5. The output's first row is row 5 of the input's 8s (columns 3-5), which is [8,8,8]. The second row of the output is row 6 of the input's 8s (columns 3-5), which is [8,8,8], but the output is [0,0,8]. That doesn't match. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the output's rows are determined by the presence of 5s below the 8s. For instance, if there's a 5 below an 8 in a certain position, the output row has an 8 there. Let's check Example 1. The input's row 5 has 8s in columns 3-5. The row below (row 6) also has 8s. But the output's second row is [0,0,8]. How does that work?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a kind of mask where each 8 is present if there's an 8 in the same column and subsequent rows. For example, the first row of the output is the first row of 8s. The second row has 8s where there are 8s in the next row, etc. But this doesn't fit Example 1's output.\n\nAnother possible clue: Example 3's output has [8,8,0]. The input's 8s are in columns 3-5, rows 4-7. The output's first row is [8,8,0], which suggests that the third column of the first row of 8s is not an 8. But looking at the input's row 4, columns 3-5 are 8,8,8. So the output's first row should be [8,8,8]. But the actual output is [8,8,0]. This contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is not directly from the input's 8s but based on the surrounding 5s. For example, the output's 8s are positioned where there are 5s to the left and right. In Example 3's input, row 4 has 8s in columns 3-5. The 5s are in column 2 and 6. So the 8s are between them. But the output's first row is [8,8,0]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is based on how the 5s converge. For instance, the 5s form a narrowing path, and the output represents the remaining path. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding the pattern, I'll try to summarize possible observations:\n\n- The output is a 3x3 grid.\n\n- The first row of the output has as many 8s as the width of the 8s' block.\n\n- The subsequent rows have fewer 8s, possibly based on where the 5s start to encroach.\n\n- For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has an 8 only in the third column, which might correspond to the rightmost column of the 8s block in that layer.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother idea: in the input, the 5s form two vertical lines. The 8s are between them. The output is the top of this 'channel' and how it narrows. So the first row of the output is the full width, and subsequent rows show where the channel narrows. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has an 8 in the third column, indicating that the channel has narrowed to the right. But how is this determined from the input.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the 5s are in columns 2 and 6 in all rows. The 8s are between them. So the channel doesn't narrow. So why does the output's second row have only one 8? This contradicts.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe the answer is similar to Example 3 and Example 1. For the test input, which has 8s in six rows, perhaps the output's first row is [8,8,8], the second row [0,0,8], and the third row [0,0,0]. But Example 1's output has this pattern when there are three rows of 8s. The test input has six rows, but maybe the pattern is similar.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the 8s' block and then, for each subsequent row in the output, moving the 8s to the right. For example, the first row is all 8s, the second row shifts right by one, filling the left with zeros, the third shifts right again. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the 8s and then for each row in the output, only keep the 8s that are in the same column as the previous row. For example, first row [8,8,8], second row only the 8s that are in the same columns as the first row. But that doesn't explain Example 1's output.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs have 8s only in the first few positions. For instance, in Example 3, the output's first row has [8,8,0]. This suggests that the 8s are only present in the first two columns. Looking at the input's first row of 8s (row 4), columns 3-5 are 8s, but the output's first row is [8,8,0]. So maybe the output is taking the first three columns of the 8s' block, but if the 8s are wider than three, they are cut off. But Example 0's input has 8s in two columns, but the output has three. So that's not matching.\n\nMaybe the output is the three rightmost columns of the 8s' block. For Example 3's input, the 8s are in three columns. Taking the three rightmost would be the same. But the output's first row is [8,8,0], which doesn't match.\n\nI think I need to look for a different approach. Let's consider that the output is the result of some matrix operation on the input. For example, each element in the output is determined by looking at a 3x3 window in the input. For example, the output's (i,j) is 8 if the corresponding window in the input has a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output: first row is all 8s. The input's row 4 (where the 8s are) has 8,8. So maybe a window around those 8s. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the top-left 3x3 of the input. But Example 0's input starts with zeros, which would make the output zeros, which is not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the result of applying a mask that selects every other row and column from the input's 8s structure. For example, in Example 1's input, the 8s are in rows 5-7. Selecting every other row would take rows 5 and 7, but the output has three rows, so that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a compressed version where each row represents the presence of 8s in a certain horizontal layer. For example, the first row of the output is the top layer of 8s, the second row the middle layer, and the third row the bottom layer. Each column in the output corresponds to a column in the input's 8s structure. If a column has an 8 in the top layer, it's 8 in the output's first row. If it has an 8 in the middle layer, 8 in the second row, and so on. But how does this work with varying numbers of layers.\n\nFor the test input, which has six layers of 8s (rows 2-7), the top three layers (rows 2-4) would correspond to the output's three rows. Each column in these three rows has 8s, so the output would be three rows of [8,8,8]. But none of the training examples have this. Example 1 has three layers of 8s, so the output would have three rows of [8,8,8], but its output has only two rows with 8s. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, given time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the closest training example.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe input has 8s in columns 3-5, spanning rows 2-7. The 5s are in columns 2 and 6. The output needs to be 3x3. Looking at Example 1, which also has 5s in columns 2 and 6, and 8s in columns 3-5, the output is [8,8,8], [0,0,8], [0,0,0]. \n\nIn Example 1's input, the 8s are in rows 5-7. The output's first row is all 8s (from row 5), the second row has 8 in the third column (maybe row 6), and third is zero. \n\nThe test input's 8s are in rows 2-7. If the output is generated similarly to Example 1, then the first row would be the first row of 8s (row 2), which has three 8s \u2192 [8,8,8]. The second row would be row 3, which also has three 8s \u2192 but Example 1's second row has [0,0,8]. So perhaps it's not the same. Alternatively, maybe the output is structured based on how the 5s are arranged below the 8s.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first row is the first layer of 8s, the second row is the layer where the 5s start to appear below, and the third row is zero. For the test input, the 8s are followed by more 8s, so perhaps the output's first three layers are all 8s. But this contradicts Example 1's case.\n\nAnother approach: look at the number of 5s below the 8s. For example, in Example 1, after the 8s in row 7, the next row (row 8) has 5s in column 3. Maybe this affects the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll guess that the test input's output is similar to Example 1's output, but with the first three rows of 8s. However, based on the structure, the output might be:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not certain. Alternatively, since the test input's 8s are in six rows, perhaps the output's three rows are all [8,8,8].\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, when there are multiple layers of 8s, the output's first row is all 8s, the second row has fewer, and the third is zeros. So for the test input with six layers, maybe the output is:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nBut none of the training examples have this, so this is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the output is [8,8,8], [0,0,0], [0,0,0], similar to Example 0 and 2, but that depends on how the 5s are arranged. In the test input, the 5s are in columns 2 and 6, and the 8s are in 3-5. So the output might be [8,8,8], [0,0,0], [0,0,0], but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's input, which has 8s in four rows, the output is [8,8,0], then zeros. So maybe when there are more than three layers, the output's first row is [8,8,0], but this doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess based on similar examples. The test input's structure resembles Example 1, but with more rows of 8s. Example 1's output is [8,8,8], [0,0,8], [0,0,0]. The test input might follow the same pattern, resulting in the same output. But why?\n\nAlternatively, since the test input has more layers, maybe the output's second row has 8s. But without a clear pattern, I'm unsure. \n\nAnother possible approach: the output's rows are determined by the presence of 5s in the same column in the row below the 8s. For example, if in the row below an 8 there's a 5, then the output's next row has a zero. For Example 1, the 8s are in rows 5-7. Row 8 has 5s in column 3. So the output's second row (corresponding to row 6) has an 8 only in column 3. But why?\n\nThis is too vague. Given the time, I'll proceed with the answer similar to Example 1.",
