        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 13x13 grid of numbers, and the output is a 4x4 grid. The challenge is to see how the input maps to the output.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the first example. The input has several rows with numbers like 8, 2, 1, 3. The output for example 0 is four rows: [8,8,2,2], [8,0,0,2], [3,0,0,1], [3,3,1,1]. Hmm. Maybe the output is combining different blocks from the input?\n\nLooking at the input grid of example 0, the 8's are in rows 2 and 3 (if we start counting from 0), columns 6 and 7. Then the 2's are in rows 3 and 4, columns 1 and 2. The 1's are in rows 7 and 8, columns 8 and 9. The 3's are in rows 9 and 10, columns 3 and 4. \n\nWait, the output seems to take these blocks and arrange them in a 4x4 grid. For example, the first row of the output is [8,8,2,2], which could be combining the two 8's from row 1 and the two 2's from row 3. But how exactly are they arranged?\n\nAnother thought: maybe each 2x2 block from the input is transformed into a 4x4 output by some kind of rotation or rearrangement. Let's look closer. The output in example 0's first row is [8,8,2,2]. The second row is [8,0,0,2]. Third row [3,0,0,1], fourth [3,3,1,1]. \n\nWait, the 8's in the input form a 2x2 block (two rows with 8,8 and 8,0). Similarly, the 2's are in two rows (2,2 and 0,2). Then the 1's are 0,1 and 1,1, and the 3's are 3,0 and 3,3. So each of these 2x2 blocks from the input are being placed into the output in a specific way. But how are they arranged in the output?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first two rows might correspond to the 8's and 2's. The third and fourth rows correspond to the 3's and 1's. So perhaps the output is combining the 2x2 blocks from each of the four corners of the input, but rotated or something.\n\nWait, maybe the input has four different numbers (like 8,2,1,3 in example 0) each forming a 2x2 block. The output arranges these four blocks into a 4x4 grid. But how?\n\nIn example 0's input, the 8's are in the middle-left area. The 2's are more towards the top-left. The 1's are bottom-middle, and 3's are bottom-left. So maybe the output is arranged in the order of the numbers, but each 2x2 block is transformed into a 2x2 quadrant in the 4x4 output. For example:\n\nTake each 2x2 block from the input, and arrange them in the output's quadrants. Like, the first quadrant (top-left) is the 8's block, then top-right is the 2's, bottom-left the 3's, and bottom-right the 1's. But when arranged, how do they fit into the 4x4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 2x2 block from the input is split into four elements and placed in the output in a certain order. Let's see the 8's in example 0's input are:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 2x2 block for 8 is:\n\n8 8\n\n8 0\n\nThen the 2's:\n\nRow 3: [0,2,2,0,...]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,0,...]\n\nSo:\n\n2 2\n\n0 2\n\nThe 1's:\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo:\n\n0 1\n\n1 1\n\nThe 3's:\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,3,0,...]\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,3,3,0...]\n\nSo:\n\n3 0\n\n3 3\n\nSo the four 2x2 blocks are:\n\n8 8\n\n8 0\n\n2 2\n\n0 2\n\n3 0\n\n3 3\n\n0 1\n\n1 1\n\nThen the output of example0 is:\n\n[8,8,2,2]\n\n[8,0,0,2]\n\n[3,0,0,1]\n\n[3,3,1,1]\n\nSo if you look, the first two rows of the output are combining the first two blocks (8's and 2's). Let's see:\n\nRow 0 of output: [8,8,2,2] \u2192 first row of 8's block (8,8) concatenated with first row of 2's block (2,2)\n\nRow 1 of output: [8,0,0,2] \u2192 second row of 8's block (8,0) and second row of 2's block (0,2)\n\nThen rows 2 and 3: the 3's and 1's blocks.\n\nRow2: [3,0,0,1] \u2192 first row of 3's block (3,0) and first row of 1's block (0,1)\n\nRow3: [3,3,1,1] \u2192 second row of 3's block (3,3) and second row of 1's block (1,1)\n\nSo the pattern is that each pair of 2x2 blocks are combined by their rows. So two blocks (A and B) are arranged such that the first two rows of the output are the first row of A followed by first row of B, then second row of A followed by second row of B. Then the same for the next two blocks (C and D) in the next two rows of the output.\n\nBut how are the blocks ordered? In example0, the blocks are 8,2,3,1. How are these selected? Maybe the order is based on the numerical order of the numbers. In example0, the numbers are 8,2,1,3. But in the output, they are ordered as 8,2,3,1. Wait, but 1 comes after 3. So that's not numerical order. Alternatively, perhaps the order is based on their positions in the input grid.\n\nLooking at the input, the 8's are in rows 1 and 2 (assuming 0-based), the 2's in rows 3 and 4, the 1's in rows7 and 8, and 3's in rows9 and 10. So maybe the order is top to bottom. So 8 (earliest in the grid), then 2, then 1, then 3. But in the output, it's 8,2,3,1. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the order is left to right, top to bottom. Let's see:\n\nThe 8's are in columns 6-7. The 2's are columns 1-2. So maybe 2's come first, but in the output, 8 comes first. That doesn't fit. So perhaps the order is based on the value of the number. But in example0's output, the order is 8,2,3,1. That's descending order except 3 is before 1. So 8 is highest, then 2, then 3, then 1. But that's 8,2,3,1. So not ordered by value. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is the order in which the blocks appear in the input when scanned row by row. Let's check example0's input:\n\nLooking for the first occurrence of each number. 8 first appears in row1 (row index 1), then 2 in row3, 1 in row7, 3 in row9. So the order would be 8,2,1,3. But the output is ordered 8,2,3,1. That doesn't fit. So maybe the blocks are ordered based on the order of their top-left cell's position. Let's see:\n\nFor 8: the first occurrence is row1, column6 (assuming 0-based). For 2: row3, column1. For 1: row7, column8. For 3: row9, column3. If we order these by row first, then column, the order would be 8 (row1), then 2 (row3), then 3 (row9), then 1 (row7). Wait, row7 comes before row9. So the order would be 8 (row1), 2 (row3), 1 (row7), 3 (row9). But in the output, it's 8,2,3,1. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blocks are ordered based on their value. So 8 is highest, then 3, then 2, then 1. But in example0's output, it's 8,2,3,1. So that's 8 (highest), then 2 (lower), then 3 (higher than 2), which breaks the order. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is based on the quadrant they are in the input. For example, 8 in the top-left, 2 in top-right, 3 in bottom-left, 1 in bottom-right. Then arranging them in that order. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's input, 8's are in the middle-left. 2's are in the left side. 3's are in the bottom-left. 1's are in the middle-right. So perhaps the quadrants are not exact. Maybe the input is divided into four quadrants, and each quadrant's block is taken. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the four 2x2 blocks, sorted by their top-left position in row-major order, and then pairing them in the order of first two and last two, then interleaving their rows. Let's see.\n\nIn example0's input, the blocks are:\n\n8's block starts at (1,6), 2's at (3,1), 1's at (7,8), 3's at (9,3). If sorted in row-major order (row first, then column), the order would be 8 (row1), 2 (row3), 3 (row9), 1 (row7). Wait, no. The 3's block is at row9, column3. The 1's are at row7, column8. So in row-major order, the order would be 8 (row1), 2 (row3), 1 (row7), 3 (row9). But in the output, the order is 8,2,3,1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me list all the top-left positions:\n\nBlock 8: row1, column6\n\nBlock 2: row3, column1\n\nBlock1: row7, column8\n\nBlock3: row9, column3\n\nSo row order is 1,3,7,9. So the order would be 8,2,1,3. But the output has 8,2,3,1. So that's not matching. So perhaps another approach.\n\nLooking at example1's input and output:\n\nInput has numbers 8,1,2,4. The output is [1,1,8,8], [1,0,0,8], [4,0,0,2], [4,4,2,2]. So in example1's output, the first two rows are combining 1's and 8's blocks. Then the next two rows combine 4's and 2's. So the order here is 1,8,4,2. But in the input, the order of appearance of the blocks would be 8 (row1, column8?), 1 (row3, column2), 2 (row5, column8?), 4 (row9, column4). So sorted by row, then column, the order would be 1 (row3), 2 (row5),4 (row9), 8 (row1). No, row1 comes first, so 8's block is first. But example1's output starts with 1's and 8's. So that's conflicting. So maybe the ordering is not based on the position in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are sorted in ascending order, and the blocks are arranged in the output in that order, but each pair is combined. For example0, the numbers are 1,2,3,8. So sorted as 1,2,3,8. But in the output, the order is 8,2,3,1. That doesn't fit. In example1, numbers are 1,2,4,8. Sorted would be 1,2,4,8. But the output starts with 1,8, then 4,2. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nHmm. Maybe the order is based on the direction of the blocks. For example, in example0, the 8's are in the left part, 2's in left as well, 3's in lower left, 1's in lower right. So perhaps the output arranges the blocks in clockwise order: top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output in example0: the first two rows are combining 8 and 2, the next two rows combine 3 and 1. So maybe the blocks are arranged in pairs. Like the first pair (8 and 2) and the second pair (3 and 1). But how are the pairs determined? Maybe based on being in the same vertical section of the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is taking each 2x2 block, rotating them 90 degrees counter-clockwise, then placing them in the output in some order.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's take another approach. Let's see how the input blocks are transformed into the output.\n\nFor example0:\n\n8's block is:\n\n8 8\n\n8 0\n\nThe first row of the output's first two rows uses the first row of the 8's block (8,8) and the first row of the 2's block (2,2), making [8,8,2,2].\n\nThen the second row of the output's first two rows is [8,0,0,2], which is the second row of the 8's block (8,0) and the second row of the 2's block (0,2).\n\nSimilarly, the next two rows of the output combine the 3's and 1's blocks.\n\n3's block:\n\n3 0\n\n3 3\n\n1's block:\n\n0 1\n\n1 1\n\nSo the third row of the output is [3,0,0,1] \u2192 first row of 3's (3,0) and first row of 1's (0,1).\n\nFourth row is [3,3,1,1] \u2192 second row of 3's (3,3) and second row of 1's (1,1).\n\nSo the pattern is that the output is formed by taking two 2x2 blocks from the input, and arranging their rows side by side. Then the next two blocks are arranged similarly.\n\nBut which blocks are paired together? In example0, 8 and 2 are paired, 3 and 1 are paired. In example1, 1 and 8 are paired, 4 and 2 are paired.\n\nLooking at example1's input:\n\nThe 1's block is:\n\n1 1\n\n1 0\n\nThe 8's block is:\n\n0 8\n\n8 8\n\nWait, no. In example1's input, the 8's are in rows 1 and 2, columns 8-9. So row1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0], row2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So the 8's block is:\n\n8 8\n\n0 8\n\nThe 1's block is in rows3 and4, columns2-3: row3: [0,0,1,1,0,...], row4: [0,0,1,0,0,...]. So:\n\n1 1\n\n1 0\n\nThe 2's block is in rows5 and6, columns8-9: row5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0], row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So:\n\n2 0\n\n2 2\n\nThe 4's block is in rows9 and10, columns4-5: row9: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], row10: [0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So:\n\n4 0\n\n4 4\n\nThen the output is:\n\n[1,1,8,8] \u2192 first rows of 1's and 8's blocks: 1 1 (from 1's first row) and 8 8 (from 8's first row)\n\n[1,0,0,8] \u2192 second rows of 1's (1 0) and 8's (0 8)\n\nThen [4,0,0,2] \u2192 first rows of 4's (4 0) and 2's (2 0)\n\n[4,4,2,2] \u2192 second rows of 4's (4 4) and 2's (2 2)\n\nSo the pairing is 1 and 8, then 4 and 2. But why? What determines the pairing order?\n\nLooking at the input for example1, the 1's are in the upper part (rows3-4), 8's in rows1-2, 2's in rows5-6, 4's in rows9-10. So the pairing is upper blocks first (1 and 8) then lower blocks (4 and 2). But how? The order seems arbitrary. Maybe the pairing is based on the vertical position of the blocks. For example, 1's and 8's are in the top half of the input, so they are paired first. 4's and 2's are in the bottom half. But in example0, 8's and 2's are in upper half, 3's and 1's in lower. So their pairing is upper first, then lower.\n\nWait, example0's input:\n\n8's block is at rows1-2 (assuming first row is 0), which is upper half. 2's block is rows3-4, which is upper-middle. 3's block is rows9-10 (lower), 1's in rows7-8 (middle-lower). So perhaps the pairing is based on vertical position. The first two blocks encountered when scanning the input from top to bottom, left to right. So in example0, the first two blocks are 8 and 2. Then the next two are 1 and 3? But in example0's output, the pairs are 8-2 and 3-1. Hmm, maybe it's the first two and the last two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four blocks are sorted based on their vertical position (row of top-left element) and the two with the highest positions are paired first, then the next two. In example0, the order would be 8 (row1), 2 (row3), 1 (row7), 3 (row9). So pairing 8-2 and 1-3. But the output pairs 8-2 and 3-1. Wait, in example0's output, the second pair is 3-1. So that would be the third and fourth blocks in the sorted order. So maybe the order is first pair the first two blocks, then the next two. But in example1's case, the order is 1,8,4,2. So the pairs are 1-8 and 4-2. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blocks are ordered based on the row of their top-left element, and then paired in the order of first and second, third and fourth. Let's check example0:\n\nBlocks in order of top-left row:\n\n8 (row1), 2 (row3), 1 (row7), 3 (row9). So pairs are (8,2) and (1,3). But the output pairs (8,2) and (3,1). So the third and fourth are reversed. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is created by combining the four 2x2 blocks into a 4x4 grid, arranged in the order of the numbers. But how?\n\nAnother approach: in example0's output, the numbers are 8,2,3,1. So the order is 8, then 2, then 3, then 1. In example1's output, the numbers are 1,8,4,2. So the order is 1,8,4,2. Maybe the order is determined by the numerical value of the blocks. In example0, 8 is highest, then 2, 3, 1. But 3 is higher than 2, but in the output, 2 comes before 3. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the order could be based on the sum of the elements in each block. For example0's blocks:\n\n8's block sum: 8+8+8+0 = 24\n\n2's: 2+2+0+2 =6\n\n1's: 0+1+1+1=3\n\n3's:3+0+3+3=9\n\nSo the order would be 24,9,6,3 \u2192 which would be 8,3,2,1. But the output is 8,2,3,1. So sum order is 8,3,2,1. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's try to find a different pattern. Looking at the output structure, each pair of rows in the output corresponds to two different 2x2 blocks. The first two rows of the output are from the first two blocks, and the next two from the next two blocks. Each block's rows are interleaved with the other block's rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is combining two 2x2 blocks into a 2x4 row, then stacking them. So for example, the first two rows of the output are the two 2x2 blocks placed side by side. Then the next two rows are the other two blocks placed side by side.\n\nBut how are the blocks chosen? For example0, the first two blocks are 8 and 2, placed side by side. The next two are 3 and 1. So the output is:\n\nBlock8 | Block2\n\nBlock3 | Block1\n\nBut each block's rows are arranged in their own columns. So the first row of the output is the first row of block8 and first row of block2. Second row is the second row of block8 and second row of block2. Then the third row is first row of block3 and first row of block1. Fourth row is second row of block3 and second row of block1.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\noutput_row0 = blockA_row0 + blockB_row0\n\noutput_row1 = blockA_row1 + blockB_row1\n\noutput_row2 = blockC_row0 + blockD_row0\n\noutput_row3 = blockC_row1 + blockD_row1\n\nThe question is, how are blocks A, B, C, D selected from the input's four 2x2 blocks.\n\nIn example0, blocks are 8,2,3,1. So A=8, B=2, C=3, D=1.\n\nIn example1, the output is:\n\n[1,1,8,8]\n\n[1,0,0,8]\n\n[4,0,0,2]\n\n[4,4,2,2]\n\nHere, blocks A=1, B=8, C=4, D=2.\n\nSo how are the blocks ordered here?\n\nIn example1's input, the blocks are 8 (rows1-2, columns8-9), 1 (rows3-4, columns2-3), 2 (rows5-6, columns8-9), 4 (rows9-10, columns4-5).\n\nSo the order in the output is 1,8,4,2. So the order is 1 comes before 8, which is not the order of their top-left rows. 1's block starts at row3, which is after 8's row1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blocks are ordered based on the value of the number. In example1, the numbers are 1,8,4,2. Ordered by value: 1,2,4,8. But the output order is 1,8,4,2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is determined by the position of the block in the input grid, considering their centers. For example, the block with the leftmost center comes first, then the next, etc.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Maybe there's another way. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nWait, in both examples, the output's first two rows combine the first and second blocks, and the last two rows combine the third and fourth. Also, the order of the blocks in the output is such that the first and third blocks are in the left part of the output, and the second and fourth in the right part.\n\nBut how to determine the order of the blocks in the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the four 2x2 blocks in the order they appear when scanning the input in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom), and then pairing them as first and second, third and fourth.\n\nFor example0's input, the blocks are:\n\n8's block starts at row1, column6 (earlier in scanning)\n\n2's block at row3, column1 (next in row-major order)\n\nThen 1's block at row7, column8.\n\nThen 3's block at row9, column3.\n\nWait, but row9 comes after row7. So in row-major order, the order would be 8,2,1,3.\n\nBut the output pairs 8 and 2, then 3 and 1. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is based on the first occurrence of the number in the input. For example, in example0, the numbers are 8,2,1,3. The order they first appear is 8 (row1), then 2 (row3), then 1 (row7), then 3 (row9). So the blocks are ordered as 8,2,1,3. Then the pairs are 8+2, 1+3. But the output has 8+2 and 3+1. So that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blocks are ordered based on the number's value in descending order. Example0's numbers are 8,3,2,1. So ordered as 8,3,2,1. Then paired as 8+3 and 2+1. But the output is 8+2 and 3+1. So that's not.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the test input and see if I can find the pattern there.\n\nTest input:\n\nLooking for 2x2 blocks. The input has:\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nSo a 6's block:\n\n6 0\n\n6 6\n\nBut rows2 and3, columns3-4 (0-based):\n\nRow2, column3 is 6. Row3, columns2-3: 6,6. Wait, perhaps the 6's block is:\n\nRow2: columns3 is 6, column4 is 0.\n\nRow3: columns2 is 6, column3 is 6.\n\nSo the 2x2 block is:\n\n6 0\n\n6 6\n\nThen, looking for other blocks:\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo 1's block is:\n\n1 0\n\n1 1\n\nThen, rows9-10, columns2-3:\n\nRow9: [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow10: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo 3's block is:\n\n3 3\n\n3 0\n\nAnd the 8's block is in rows2-3, columns10-11:\n\nRow2: 8,8\n\nRow3: 0,8\n\nSo 8's block:\n\n8 8\n\n0 8\n\nSo the four blocks are 6,1,3,8.\n\nNow, how are these arranged in the output? The test input's blocks are 6,8,1,3. So the output would need to combine these four blocks into a 4x4 grid according to the pattern.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, the order of the blocks in the output is such that in example0, the output is 8,2,3,1. In example1, it's 1,8,4,2. So perhaps the order is determined by the position of the block's top-left corner in the input grid, ordered first by column, then row. Or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is based on the columns where the blocks are located. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's test input:\n\nBlocks:\n\n6's block: row2, column3.\n\n8's block: row2, column10.\n\n1's block: row6, column6.\n\n3's block: row9, column2.\n\nOrdering by column first (smallest to largest), then row:\n\n3's block (column2), 6's (column3), 1's (column6), 8's (column10). So order would be 3,6,1,8. But how would this fit into the output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is based on the column of the top-left corner. For example0's blocks:\n\n8's column6.\n\n2's column1.\n\n3's column3.\n\n1's column8.\n\nOrdered by column: 2 (column1), 3 (column3), 8 (column6), 1 (column8). So example0's output would start with 2's block, but in reality it starts with 8's. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is based on the position where the block starts (row, column), sorted first by row, then by column. For example0's blocks:\n\n8's (row1, column6), 2's (row3, column1), 1's (row7, column8), 3's (row9, column3). Ordered by row first:\n\n8 (row1), 2 (row3), 1 (row7), 3 (row9). So the order would be 8,2,1,3. Then the pairs are 8+2 and 1+3. But the output is 8,2,3,1. So the pairs are 8+2 and 3+1. So perhaps the pairing is first and second, then fourth and third.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is 8,2,3,1 because 3's block is in a lower row than 1's. But in example0, 3's block is in row9, which is lower than 1's row7. So why is 3's block in the output after 2's but before 1's? That doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's think of another angle. The output for the test input should be four rows, each four elements. The four 2x2 blocks are 6,8,1,3. How to arrange them.\n\nIn example0, the output pairs 8 and 2, then 3 and 1. So perhaps the pairs are based on being in opposite areas of the input. For example, 8 and 2 are in the upper part, 3 and 1 are in the lower. But in the test input, 6 and 8 are upper, 1 and 3 are lower. So perhaps the pairs are 6 and 8, then 1 and 3.\n\nBut example0's output starts with the highest number (8) and example1's starts with 1 and 8. So there's no clear numerical order.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's blocks:\n\n6's block is at row2, column3.\n\n8's at row2, column10.\n\n1's at row6, column6.\n\n3's at row9, column2.\n\nIf we order the blocks based on their row, then column:\n\n6 (row2, column3)\n\n8 (row2, column10) \u2192 same row, higher column comes after.\n\n1 (row6, column6)\n\n3 (row9, column2)\n\nSo order is 6,8,1,3.\n\nThen the pairs would be 6 and 8, then 1 and 3.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nFirst two rows: combining 6's and 8's blocks.\n\nThird and fourth rows: combining 1's and 3's blocks.\n\nSo for example, the first row would be first row of 6's block (6,0) and first row of 8's block (8,8) \u2192 [6,0,8,8]\n\nSecond row: second row of 6's (6,6) and second row of 8's (0,8) \u2192 [6,6,0,8]\n\nThird row: first row of 1's (1,0) and first row of 3's (3,3) \u2192 [1,0,3,3]\n\nFourth row: second row of 1's (1,1) and second row of 3's (3,0) \u2192 [1,1,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output for example0 is:\n\n[8,8,2,2]\n\n[8,0,0,2]\n\n[3,0,0,1]\n\n[3,3,1,1]\n\nHere, the first two rows are combining two blocks (8 and 2), but the first row is the first row of each block concatenated. Similarly, for the test case, if we pair 6 and 8, then 3 and 1, but how?\n\nWait, in example0, the first two rows of the output are:\n\n[8,8,2,2] \u2192 first rows of 8 and 2.\n\n[8,0,0,2] \u2192 second rows of 8 and 2.\n\nSo if test input's pairs are 6 and8, then 1 and3, then:\n\nRow0: [6,0,8,8]\n\nRow1: [6,6,0,8]\n\nRow2: [1,0,3,3]\n\nRow3: [1,1,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the order of the pairs in the output for example1 is [1,1,8,8], which is 1's first row and 8's first row. So the first pair is 1 and8. The order of the pairs in the output depends on the order of the blocks in the pair.\n\nBut how to determine which block comes first in the pair. In example1's output, the first pair is 1 and8. So perhaps the pair is ordered based on the value of the block's number, with lower numbers first. Example1's pair is 1 and8, 4 and2. So 1<8, 4>2. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps within each pair, the order is based on the block's position. For example, in example1, the 1's block is to the left of the 8's block in the input. So left comes first.\n\nIn example1's input, the 1's block is in columns2-3 (left), 8's in columns8-9 (right). So the pair is 1 (left) and8 (right), hence in the output, left block's rows come first. So the first part of each output row is the left block's row, and the second part is the right block's row.\n\nSimilarly, in example0's input, the 8's block is in columns6-7 (middle-left), 2's in columns1-2 (left). But the pair is 8 and2, which is right then left. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order within the pair is determined by which block appears first when scanning left to right. For example0's pair 8 and2: 8's block is at column6, which is to the right of 2's column1. But in the output, the 8's block comes first. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe the pairs are ordered based on the numerical value of the block's number. So in example0's pair 8 and2, 8 is higher, so comes first. In example1's pair 1 and8, 1 comes first. So perhaps the order within the pair is from lower to higher. So in example1's first pair, 1 and8, ordered 1 then8. In example0's first pair, 8 and2, ordered from higher to lower. But that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps within each pair, the order is based on the block's position in the input. For example, the block that appears first in the input (row-major order) comes first in the pair.\n\nIn example0, the 8's block is first in row-major order, then 2's. So pair is 8 and2. In example1, the 8's block is at row1, column8, while 1's block is at row3, column2. So in row-major order, 1's block comes after 8's? No. Because row1 comes before row3. So 8's block appears first. But in example1's output, the pair is 1 and8. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that the pairing order is not determined by row-major order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pairing is such that the first block in the pair is the one with the lower row, and the second with higher. If two blocks are in the same row, then the leftmost comes first.\n\nIn example0, the 8's block is in row1, 2's in row3. So first comes 8, then 2. In example1, the 1's block is in row3, the 8's in row1. So the order should be 8, then1. But in example1's output, the pair is 1 and8. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to apply the pattern observed in the training examples to the test input.\n\nIn the test input, there are four 2x2 blocks: 6,8,1,3.\n\nThe output needs to combine them into a 4x4 grid. The key is to determine which two blocks are paired and the order.\n\nLooking at example0 and example1, the output pairs seem to be the two largest numbers first. But in example0, 8 and2 are paired, then 3 and1. In example1, the pairs are 1 and8 (lower and higher), then4 and2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pairs are formed by the two blocks with the highest numbers and the two with the lowest. Or perhaps the order is based on the sum of the block's numbers.\n\nAlternatively, given the test input's blocks are 6,8,1,3. The numbers are 1,3,6,8. So highest are 8 and6. Then 3 and1. So perhaps the pairs are 6 and8, then3 and1.\n\nBut how to order the pairs. Let's see:\n\nIf the pairs are 6 and8, then3 and1.\n\nThen the first two rows of the output would be the first rows of 6 and8, then second rows of 6 and8.\n\nThen the next two rows would be first rows of3 and1, then second rows of3 and1.\n\nSo:\n\n6's block:\n\nRow0: 6,0\n\nRow1:6,6\n\n8's block:\n\nRow0:8,8\n\nRow1:0,8\n\nSo first output row: [6,0,8,8]\n\nSecond: [6,6,0,8]\n\nThen,3's block:\n\nRow0:3,3\n\nRow1:3,0\n\n1's block:\n\nRow0:1,0\n\nRow1:1,1\n\nThird output row: [3,3,1,0]\n\nFourth: [3,0,1,1]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the order of the pairs in the output might be different. For example, in example0's output, the second pair is3 and1. So the third row is [3,0,0,1], which is3's first row and1's first row.\n\nSimilarly, the test input's third row would be3's first row and1's first row: [3,3,1,0].\n\nBut wait, in example0's third row, it's [3,0,0,1], which is3's first row (3,0) and1's first row (0,1). So the order is3 first, then1.\n\nIn the test input's case, the third pair would be3 and1. So the third row would be3's first row (3,3) and1's first row (1,0) \u2192 [3,3,1,0]. Fourth row:3's second row (3,0) and1's second row (1,1) \u2192 [3,0,1,1].\n\nBut the training examples have the first pair's blocks arranged side by side, and the second pair's as well. So for the test input, the output would be:\n\n[6,0,8,8]\n\n[6,6,0,8]\n\n[3,3,1,0]\n\n[3,0,1,1]\n\nBut does this match the pattern from the training examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pairs are ordered based on the numerical value of the numbers in the block. So the highest number comes first. In the test input's case, 8 is the highest, then6, then3, then1. So pairs would be8 and6, then3 and1.\n\nBut then the first two rows would be8's and6's blocks. So:\n\nFirst output row:8's first row (8,8) +6's first row (6,0) \u2192 [8,8,6,0]\n\nSecond row:8's second row (0,8) +6's second row (6,6) \u2192 [0,8,6,6]\n\nThird and fourth rows:3's and1's blocks. So:\n\nThird row:3's first row (3,3) +1's first row (1,0) \u2192 [3,3,1,0]\n\nFourth row:3's second row (3,0) +1's second row (1,1) \u2192 [3,0,1,1]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' pattern. In example0, the first pair is8 and2, not ordered by value.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern might not be based on numerical value.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is formed by pairing the two blocks that are closest to the top and bottom of the input. For example, in example0, 8's and2's are in the upper part, then3 and1 in the lower. In example1, the pairs are upper (1,8) and lower (4,2).\n\nIn the test input, the 6 and8 blocks are in the upper rows (rows2 and3), and1 and3 in lower rows. So the pairs would be6 and8, then1 and3.\n\nBut how to order them within the pairs. In example0's first pair, the higher block (8) comes first. In example1's first pair, the lower value (1) comes first. So this doesn't help.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let's try to summarize the pattern observed:\n\nThe output is a 4x4 grid formed by concatenating rows of pairs of 2x2 blocks from the input. Each pair of blocks contributes two rows to the output. The first two rows of the output are the first rows of the two blocks followed by their second rows. The next two rows are the same for the other pair of blocks.\n\nThe key is determining which blocks are paired together and in what order.\n\nIn example0, the pairs are (8,2) and (3,1). In example1, (1,8) and (4,2).\n\nThe order of the pairs in the output is such that in example0, the first pair is (8,2), in example1, (1,8). The order within each pair seems to vary.\n\nBut in example1, the first pair is (1,8). The 1's block is in row3-4, column2-3. The 8's block is row1-2, column8-9. So the 8's block is higher up (row1) than the 1's (row3). So why is the pair ordered as 1 then8?\n\nMaybe the order within the pair is based on the block's column position. 1's block is in column2-3 (left), 8's in columns8-9 (right). So left comes first. Similarly, in example0's pair (8,2):8's block is in columns6-7 (right), 2's in columns1-2 (left). So the pair is ordered 8 (right) then2 (left), which contradicts the left-first idea.\n\nAlternatively, within a pair, the blocks are ordered based on which one appears first when scanning the input left to right, top to bottom. In example0's pair:\n\n8's block starts at row1, column6.\n\n2's block starts at row3, column1.\n\nWhen scanning the input row by row, left to right, the 2's block comes before the 8's block. But in the output pair, 8 comes first. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the blocks are paired based on their order in the input when scanned from top to bottom, left to right, and each pair is ordered as they appear.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nBlocks are:\n\n6's block: row2, column3.\n\n8's block: row2, column10.\n\n1's block: row6, column6.\n\n3's block: row9, column2.\n\nWhen scanning the input in row-major order, the order of the blocks would be:\n\n6 (row2, column3)\n\n8 (row2, column10)\n\n1 (row6, column6)\n\n3 (row9, column2)\n\nSo the pairs would be 6 and8, then1 and3.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nFirst two rows:\n\n6's first row (6,0) concatenated with8's first row (8,8) \u2192 [6,0,8,8]\n\n6's second row (6,6) concatenated with8's second row (0,8) \u2192 [6,6,0,8]\n\nNext two rows:\n\n1's first row (1,0) concatenated with3's first row (3,3) \u2192 [1,0,3,3]\n\n1's second row (1,1) concatenated with3's second row (3,0) \u2192 [1,1,3,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[6,0,8,8]\n\n[6,6,0,8]\n\n[1,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the pairs are not always ordered left to right. For example, in example0's first pair is8 and2. But in row-major order, the 2's block (row3, column1) comes before the8's block (row1, column6). So this approach may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is determined by the position of the top-left cell of each block, ordered from top to bottom and left to right. So in example0:\n\n8's block starts at (row1, column6)\n\n2's at (row3, column1)\n\n1's at (row7, column8)\n\n3's at (row9, column3)\n\nOrdering by row first, then column:\n\n8 (row1), 2 (row3), 1 (row7), 3 (row9). So pairs are8+2 and1+3. Then the output would be as observed.\n\nFor example1:\n\nBlocks are:\n\n8's starts at (row1, column8)\n\n1's at (row3, column2)\n\n2's at (row5, column8)\n\n4's at (row9, column4)\n\nOrdering by row:\n\n8 (row1), 1 (row3), 2 (row5),4 (row9). So pairs are8+1 and2+4. But the output's first pair is1+8, then4+2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting too time-consuming, and I need to provide an answer. Based on the training examples, the output pairs seem to be determined by the order of the numbers in the output. For example0: 8,2,3,1. For example1:1,8,4,2. So the first pair is the first and second numbers, the second pair is third and fourth. \n\nBut how to order the numbers. In example0's output, the order is 8,2,3,1. The numbers are sorted in descending order:8,3,2,1. But output is 8,2,3,1. So not sorted.\n\nAlternatively, the order is based on the order of the blocks in the input when scanned from top to bottom and left to right, but grouped in pairs of two. For example0, the order is8,2,1,3. Pair first two (8,2), then next two (1,3). But the output has the next two as3 and1. So perhaps it's first two and last two.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking the first and third blocks as the first pair, and second and fourth as the second pair. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the assumption that the test input's blocks are ordered based on row-major order, then paired as first and second, third and fourth. So the output would be:\n\n[6,0,8,8]\n\n[6,6,0,8]\n\n[1,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the first example's output starts with 1 and8. So perhaps the order is based on the vertical position, with higher blocks first. For the test input, 6 and8 are higher (rows2-3), then1 and3. So the pairs are6+8 and1+3.\n\nBut then the order within the pairs: perhaps left comes first. 6's block is at column3, 8's at column10. So 6 is left, so first in the pair. Then1 is at column6,3 is at column2. So 3 is left of1. So the second pair would be3 and1.\n\nSo output would be:\n\n6's block and8's block:\n\n[6,0,8,8]\n\n[6,6,0,8]\n\n3's block and1's block:\n\n[3,3,1,0]\n\n[3,0,1,1]\n\nWhich matches what I thought earlier.\n\nBut how does this align with the training examples?\n\nExample1's test input:\n\nThe pairs would be1 (row3, column2) and8 (row1, column8). Since 8 is higher up (row1) than 1 (row3), but in the output, 1 comes first. So perhaps within the pair, the order is determined by the block's numerical value. But in example1, 1 and8:1 is lower than8, so comes first.\n\nIn test input's first pair,6 and8:6 is lower than8. So if the order within the pair is lower first, then6 comes first. So the first pair is6 and8, ordered as6,8. The second pair is3 and1:3>1, so ordered as1,3.\n\nBut this is conflicting with example0's first pair, which is8 and2:8>2, so ordered as8 first. So the pattern within the pair is higher first in example0, lower first in example1. Contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the ordering within the pair is not based on numerical value. Perhaps it's based on column position. For example0's pair:8 is at column6, 2 at column1. So in the pair, the leftmost comes first. But in example0's output,8 comes first, which is right of 2. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order within the pair is determined by the order of their first occurrence in the input. For example0, the 8's block comes first, then 2's. So ordered as8 then2. In example1, the 1's block comes after the8's, but in the output, 1 comes first. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really puzzling. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial assumption that the test output is:\n\n[6,0,8,8]\n\n[6,6,0,8]\n\n[3,3,1,0]\n\n[3,0,1,1]\n\nBut comparing to the training examples' structure, the last two rows might need to be reordered. For example, in example0's output, the third row is3's first row and1's first row, and fourth row is3's second and1's second. So for the test input's third row would be3's first and1's first:\n\n3's first row:3,3\n\n1's first row:1,0\n\nSo third row:3,3,1,0\n\nFourth row:3,0,1,1\n\nWhich matches what I have. This seems to fit the pattern observed in the training examples.\n\nThus, the final answer for the test input should be:\n\n[6,0,8,8]\n\n[6,6,0,8]\n\n[3,3,1,0]\n\n[3,0,1,1]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a 13x13 grid of numbers, and the output is a 4x4 grid. The examples given must show how to transform the input into the output. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0's input. Let me visualize the input grid. Each row is a list of numbers. The non-zero numbers are 8, 2, 1, 3. The output is four rows with those numbers arranged in some way. The output is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 2]\n[8, 0, 0, 2]\n[3, 0, 0, 1]\n[3, 3, 1, 1]\n\nHmm. Let's see where the numbers come from. In the input, the 8s are in row 1 (second row) at positions 6 and 7, and row 2 has an 8 at position 6. The 2s are in rows 3 and 4, 1s in rows 7 and 8, and 3s in rows 9 and 10. Maybe the output is combining the maximum or some aggregation of these clusters. \n\nLooking at the output rows, each has four elements. The first row has 8,8,2,2. Maybe each pair comes from a different cluster. Like the first two elements are the 8s, then the 2s. The second row starts with 8, then 0s, then 2. Not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the output is grouping the clusters of numbers. Each cluster (like the two 8s in row1 and row2) contributes to a quadrant of the 4x4 grid. Let's check the positions. In Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: 8,8,2,2. So top-left quadrant (maybe) has 8s, top-right has 2s.\n\nRow1: 8,0,0,2. Then maybe the second row of the first cluster and the second row of the second cluster. Similarly, the lower rows (3 and 4 in the output) have 3s and 1s. The 3s are in row9 and 10 of the input, and 1s in rows7 and8. So maybe the output arranges the clusters in order, clockwise or something.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the input's clusters are rotated or transformed. Let's look at the positions of the numbers. For example, in Example 0 input:\n\nThe 8 cluster is in rows 1 and 2, columns 6 and 7. Then the 2s are in rows3 and4, columns1 and2. The 1s are in rows7 and8, columns7 and8. The 3s are in rows9 and10, columns3 and4. So each cluster is a 2x2 block. Wait, but some clusters might be different. Let's check:\n\nFor the 8s in Example0 input:\n\nRow1: 8,8 at columns6-7.\n\nRow2: 8 at column6, 0 at 7. So maybe it's a 2x2 block but with some zeros. But perhaps each cluster is a 2x2 block, and the output is taking the maximum values from each quadrant of the cluster? Or maybe the output is the 2x2 cluster rotated or transposed.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the first two output rows have 8s and 2s. Maybe each output row corresponds to a cluster. Let's see: the first cluster (8s) in the input has two rows. The output's first two rows could be taking those two rows, but perhaps rotated. For instance, the input's 8 cluster is:\n\nRow1: 8,8\n\nRow2:8,0\n\nIf you rotate this 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes:\n\n8,8\n\n0,8\n\nBut the output's first two rows are [8,8,2,2] and [8,0,0,2]. Wait, maybe that's combining multiple clusters. Alternatively, the output is combining four clusters into a 4x4 grid. Let's see: in Example0's input, there are four clusters: 8,2,1,3. Each cluster's 2x2 block is transformed into a 2x2 part of the output, arranged in a certain order.\n\nFor instance, the 8 cluster is in the top part of the input, 2 is next, then 3, then 1. But how are they ordered in the output? The output's first row has 8,8,2,2. Maybe each cluster is arranged in a 2x2 section of the output. So for example, the 8 cluster's 2x2 becomes the top-left 2x2, the 2 cluster becomes top-right, 3 becomes bottom-left, and 1 becomes bottom-right. Let's check.\n\nExample0's input clusters:\n\n8 cluster (rows1-2, cols6-7):\n\nRow1: 8,8\n\nRow2:8,0\n\nSo if rotated 180 degrees? Or flipped. The output's top-left 2x2 in Example0's output is:\n\nRow0:8,8\n\nRow1:8,0\n\nWhich is exactly the same as the input's 8 cluster. Then the top-right 2x2 would be the 2 cluster. The 2 cluster in input is:\n\nRow3:2,2 (cols1-2)\n\nRow4:0,2 (cols1-2?)\n\nWait, input row3 is [0,2,2,0,...], so columns1 and 2 (assuming zero-based or one-based? Wait, the lists are zero-based indices. So row3 is index 3, which in the input is:\n\n[0, 2, 2, 0, ...], so columns1 and 2 are 2 and 2. Row4 is [0,0,2,0,...], so column2 is 2. So the 2 cluster is:\n\nRow3: columns1-2: 2,2\n\nRow4: columns1-2: 0,2\n\nSo if we take that cluster as a 2x2 matrix:\n\n2 2\n\n0 2\n\nIf this is placed in the top-right of the output's first two rows. The output's first row is [8,8,2,2], so the third and fourth elements are 2,2. The second row is [8,0,0,2]. So that would be:\n\nRow0: 8,8 | 2,2\n\nRow1:8,0 | 0,2\n\nSo the 2 cluster's data is arranged as:\n\nRow3's 2,2 and row4's 0,2. So the first part is 2,2 and 0,2. But in the output's top-right, the 2,2 is from row3, and 0,2 from row4. So that's directly taken as the cluster's data. Then the bottom part of the output would be the 3 and 1 clusters.\n\n3 cluster in input is rows9-10, columns3-4. Row9 is [0,0,0,3,0,...], so column3 is 3, and row10 is [0,0,3,3,0,...], columns3-4 are 3,3. So the 3 cluster is:\n\nRow9: 3,0\n\nRow10:3,3\n\nSo that's a 2x2 block. Then the output's third row (index2) is [3,0,0,1], and fourth row [3,3,1,1]. So the 3 cluster is placed in the bottom-left, and the 1 cluster in the bottom-right.\n\nThe 1 cluster in input is rows7-8, columns7-8. Row7 has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0... So column8 is 1. Row8 has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0... So columns7-8 are 1,1. So the 1 cluster is:\n\nRow7: 0,1\n\nRow8:1,1\n\nSo the 2x2 for 1 is:\n\n0 1\n\n1 1\n\nIn the output's bottom-right quadrant:\n\nThird row's fourth element is 1, fourth row's third and fourth are 1,1. So the output's bottom-right quadrant would be:\n\n0 1\n\n1 1\n\nBut in the output, the third row is [3,0,0,1], so the 0,1 part is in the third row's third and fourth elements. Wait, perhaps the clusters are arranged in a certain order. Maybe the order of the clusters in the output is 8,2,3,1, each contributing their 2x2 blocks.\n\nPutting it together, the output is a combination of the four 2x2 clusters arranged in the order of 8 cluster (top-left), 2 cluster (top-right), 3 cluster (bottom-left), and 1 cluster (bottom-right). Each cluster is taken as a 2x2 matrix from the input and placed into the corresponding quadrant of the 4x4 output. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, the output's top-left is the 8 cluster's 2x2, which is:\n\n8 8\n\n8 0\n\nThe top-right is the 2 cluster's 2x2:\n\n2 2\n\n0 2\n\nBottom-left is 3 cluster's 2x2:\n\n3 0\n\n3 3\n\nBottom-right is 1 cluster's 2x2:\n\n0 1\n\n1 1\n\nSo arranging these four quadrants into a 4x4 grid:\n\nRow0: 8 8 | 2 2 \u2192 [8,8,2,2]\n\nRow1:8 0 | 0 2 \u2192 [8,0,0,2]\n\nRow2:3 0 | 0 1 \u2192 [3,0,0,1]\n\nRow3:3 3 |1 1 \u2192 [3,3,1,1]\n\nYes, this matches the output of Example0. Similarly, Example1's input clusters are 8,1,2,4. Let's check:\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\n[1,1,8,8]\n\n[1,0,0,8]\n\n[4,0,0,2]\n\n[4,4,2,2]\n\nSo the quadrants are 1 cluster (top-left), 8 cluster (top-right), 4 cluster (bottom-left), 2 cluster (bottom-right). The order seems to be different. Wait, in Example1's input, the clusters are 8 (rows1-2, columns8-9?), 1 (rows3-4, columns2-3?), 2 (rows5-6, columns7-8?), 4 (rows9-10, columns4-5).\n\nSo the output order is 1,8,4,2. Hmm, maybe the order is based on the cluster's position in the input. Like the clusters are ordered based on their vertical position. For example, the topmost cluster comes first. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, the clusters are:\n\n8 cluster (rows1-2) \u2192 earliest rows.\n\n2 cluster (rows3-4) \u2192 next.\n\n1 cluster (rows7-8) \u2192 later.\n\n3 cluster (rows9-10) \u2192 even later.\n\nBut in the output, the order is 8,2,3,1. Wait, that doesn't fit. Or maybe the order is based on the cluster's vertical position in the input. Let me check:\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\n- 8 cluster is at row1 (early)\n- 2 cluster at row3 (next)\n- 1 cluster at row7 (later)\n- 3 cluster at row9 (even later)\n\nBut in the output, the order is 8 (first), 2 (second), 3 (third), 1 (fourth). Wait, that's not in row order. So maybe the order is based on the cluster's number. In Example0, the numbers are 8,2,1,3. The output order is 8,2,3,1. So numbers are ordered 8,2,3,1. Not numerically. Hmm. Maybe the order is based on the cluster's starting row. 8 cluster starts at row1, 2 at row3, 3 at row9, 1 at row7. So the order in output is 8,2,1,3? But Example0's output has 8,2,3,1. That's 8 first, 2 next, then 3 and 1. Wait, the 3 cluster starts at row9, which is after 1 cluster at row7. So the order in Example0's output is 8,2,3,1. But that's not the order of their starting rows. Hmm. Maybe the clusters are ordered based on their vertical position, but the order is from top to bottom. So first the 8 cluster (rows1-2), then 2 (rows3-4), then 3 (rows9-10), then 1 (rows7-8). Wait, but 1 is in rows7-8 which is after row3-4 but before 9-10. That would be 8,2,1,3. But in the output, it's 8,2,3,1. That doesn't fit. Maybe the order is determined by the first occurrence of the cluster in the input. For example, the 8 cluster is first, then 2, then 1, then 3. Wait, in Example0's input:\n\n- 8 appears in rows1 and 2.\n\n- 2 appears in rows3 and4.\n\n- 1 in rows7 and8.\n\n- 3 in rows9 and10.\n\nSo the order of first occurrence is 8,2,1,3. But the output order is 8,2,3,1. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the clusters are ordered based on their numerical value. But in Example0, the numbers are 8,2,1,3. If ordered numerically, they would be 1,2,3,8. But the output starts with 8,2. So that's not it.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example1. The output is:\n\n[1,1,8,8]\n\n[1,0,0,8]\n\n[4,0,0,2]\n\n[4,4,2,2]\n\nSo the clusters here are 1,8,4,2. The input clusters are:\n\n- 8 in rows1-2, columns8-9.\n\n- 1 in rows3-4, columns2-3.\n\n- 2 in rows5-6, columns7-8.\n\n-4 in rows9-10, columns4-5.\n\nSo the order in the output is 1,8,4,2. So the first cluster is 1 (rows3-4), then 8 (rows1-2), then4 (rows9-10), then 2 (rows5-6). So this order doesn't follow the row order. Hmm. So how is this order determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the clusters are ordered based on their positions in the input grid, going clockwise starting from the top-left. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's input, the 8 cluster is in the upper middle part (rows1-2, columns6-7). The 2 cluster is in the left part (rows3-4, columns1-2). The 1 cluster is in the middle-right (rows7-8, columns7-8). The 3 cluster is in the lower left (rows9-10, columns3-4). If arranged in clockwise order starting from top-left, maybe the order is 8 (top-middle), 2 (left), 3 (lower-left), 1 (right). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the clusters are ordered based on the order of their first occurrence in the input. For Example0: 8 comes first in row1, then 2 in row3, then 1 in row7, then3 in row9. So the output order would be 8,2,1,3. But Example0's output is ordered 8,2,3,1. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is determined by the cluster's position in the input grid when read in a spiral order. Or perhaps the order is based on the quadrant where the cluster is located in the input. The input is a 13x13 grid. The four quadrants would be: top-left (rows 0-6, cols 0-6), top-right (rows0-6, cols7-12), bottom-left (rows7-12, cols0-6), bottom-right (rows7-12, cols7-12). So if a cluster's top-left corner is in a quadrant, it's assigned to that quadrant.\n\nIn Example0:\n\n- 8 cluster is in rows1-2, columns6-7. So the columns6-7 are on the boundary. Column6 is in top-left (0-6?), or top-right? Since columns are 0-12. Top-left quadrant would be columns0-6 (since 13 columns, middle at 6.5). So column6 is in the top-left. But the 8 cluster's columns6-7 would straddle the boundary. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, each cluster is assigned to a quadrant based on its position. The output's quadrants are ordered as top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, and the input clusters are mapped to these based on their positions.\n\nIn Example0's 8 cluster is in the top part (rows1-2), middle columns (6-7). Maybe it's considered top-right. The 2 cluster is in the top-left (columns1-2). The 3 cluster is in the lower-left (rows9-10, columns3-4). The 1 cluster is in the lower-right (rows7-8, columns7-8). So:\n\n- 8 cluster \u2192 top-right (so output quadrant top-right?), but in the output, 8 is in the top-left quadrant. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the clusters are mapped to the output quadrants in the order of their positions: first the top-left cluster, then top-right, then bottom-left, then bottom-right. So in Example0:\n\nThe 2 cluster is in columns1-2 (left side), so maybe top-left. The 8 cluster is in columns6-7 (right side), so top-right. The 3 cluster is in columns3-4 (left side of lower half), bottom-left. The 1 cluster is in columns7-8 (right side of lower half), bottom-right. So the order would be 2 (top-left), 8 (top-right),3 (bottom-left),1 (bottom-right). But Example0's output starts with 8,2,3,1. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's look for another pattern. The output's rows are each combining elements from different clusters. For example, the first row of the output is the first row of the 8 cluster and the first row of the 2 cluster. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's output row0: [8,8,2,2]. The 8 cluster's first row is [8,8], and the 2 cluster's first row is [2,2]. So combining them gives the first row of the output. Similarly, row1 of the output is the second row of the 8 cluster ([8,0]) and the second row of the 2 cluster ([0,2]). Then rows 2 and3 are the first and second rows of the 3 and 1 clusters. So the output is formed by taking the 2x2 clusters from each of the four clusters, and interleaving their rows. So:\n\nOutput rows 0 and 1: first and second rows of 8 and 2 clusters, concatenated.\n\nOutput rows 2 and3: first and second rows of 3 and 1 clusters, concatenated.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the third row is [3,0,0,1]. The 3 cluster's first row is [3,0], and the 1 cluster's first row is [0,1]. So concatenated, that's 3,0,0,1. The fourth row is [3,3,1,1], which is the second row of the 3 cluster (3,3) and the second row of the 1 cluster (1,1). So yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nThe output is a 4x4 grid formed by taking four 2x2 clusters from the input. These clusters are arranged in two pairs: the first two clusters (say A and B) form the top half of the output, with each row of the output being the corresponding rows of A and B concatenated. The next two clusters (C and D) form the bottom half, with each row being the corresponding rows of C and D concatenated. But the order of the clusters (A, B, C, D) needs to be determined.\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\nClusters in input order: 8,2,1,3.\n\nBut the output uses them in the order 8,2,3,1. Because the top two rows are 8 and 2 clusters, and bottom two are 3 and 1. So why this order? Maybe the clusters are ordered by the row where their first occurrence appears, but in Example0, 8 comes first (row1), 2 (row3), 1 (row7), 3 (row9). So the order is 8,2,1,3. But in the output, the bottom clusters are 3 and 1. So perhaps the order is 8,2,3,1, which is not the same as their row order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the clusters are ordered based on their numerical values. But in Example0, 8 comes first, then 2, then 3, then 1. But numerically, 1 would be first, but the output starts with 8. So that's not.\n\nAnother possibility: the clusters are ordered based on their position when traversing the input grid from top to bottom, left to right, and when encountering a cluster, note its top-left position. Then order the clusters in the order of their top-left position's row, and then column.\n\nFor Example0:\n\n- 8 cluster's top-left is row1, column6.\n\n- 2 cluster's top-left is row3, column1.\n\n- 1 cluster's top-left is row7, column7.\n\n-3 cluster's top-left is row9, column3.\n\nSo ordering by row first: row1 comes first, then row3, then row7, then row9. So order is 8,2,1,3. But in the output, the order is 8,2,3,1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in the output, the third and fourth clusters are 3 and 1. So perhaps after the first two clusters (8 and 2), the next two are 3 and 1, ordered based on their row. So 3 is row9, which is after row7 (1's row). So perhaps in the second pair, the order is 3 and then 1. So overall order: 8,2,3,1. So the first pair is 8 and2, ordered by their rows. The second pair is 3 and1, ordered by row (3 is row9, which is after row7). So 3 comes after1 in row order. But why would they be ordered in reverse in the second pair? That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters are grouped into pairs based on their vertical positions. The first two clusters are the first two encountered when scanning the input from top to bottom. Then the next two clusters are the next two. But in Example0, 8 (row1), 2 (row3), 1 (row7), 3 (row9). So first two are 8 and2, next two are1 and3. But the output combines 8 and2 into the top half, and 3 and1 into the bottom. So why are 3 and1 ordered as 3,1 in the output's bottom half?\n\nAlternatively, after selecting the first two clusters (8 and2), the next two are3 and1, but ordered based on row. 3 is row9, which is after 1's row7, so 3 comes after1, but in the output, 3 comes first. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nHmm, maybe the order is determined by the cluster's numerical value modulo 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters are ordered based on the numerical value of the cluster's number. But in Example0, the cluster numbers are 8,2,3,1. Ordered numerically:1,2,3,8. But the output order is8,2,3,1, which is 8,2,3,1. That's not the numerical order. But perhaps they are sorted in reverse order? 8,3,2,1. No. \n\nAlternatively, the clusters are ordered based on the size of their numbers. 8 is largest, then3, then2, then1. Which matches the order in Example0's output:8,2,3,1. Wait, but 3 is larger than2. So the order would be8,3,2,1. But in Example0, the order is8,2,3,1. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs for both examples and see if there's a pattern in how they arrange the cluster numbers.\n\nExample0's output clusters:8,2,3,1.\n\nExample1's output clusters:1,8,4,2.\n\nIn Example1, the input clusters are 8,1,2,4. The output order is1,8,4,2.\n\nSo the order in the output doesn't seem to follow the numerical order or the input row order. Let's look at the clusters' positions in Example1:\n\n- 8 cluster: rows1-2, columns8-9 (top-right)\n\n-1 cluster: rows3-4, columns2-3 (left side)\n\n-2 cluster: rows5-6, columns7-8 (middle-right)\n\n-4 cluster: rows9-10, columns4-5 (middle)\n\nThe output order is1,8,4,2. So the first pair is1 and8, the second pair is4 and2. Hmm. The 1 cluster is in the left (rows3-4), 8 is in the top-right (rows1-2), 4 is in rows9-10 (middle), and 2 is in rows5-6. So maybe the order is based on the cluster's vertical position, but in a different way. For example, the first cluster is the earliest one in the input (1 cluster starts at row3), then8 starts at row1 (earlier), but in the output, the 1 cluster is first. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters are ordered based on their horizontal position. The leftmost cluster comes first. For Example0's clusters:\n\n- 2 cluster is leftmost (columns1-2)\n\n-8 is next (columns6-7)\n\n-3 cluster (columns3-4)\n\n-1 cluster (columns7-8)\n\nSo leftmost is2, then3, then8, then1. But the output order is8,2,3,1. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the clusters are ordered in the output based on the order of their appearance when scanning the input in row-major order. For Example0:\n\nScan each row left to right, top to bottom. The first cluster encountered would be the 8 cluster (row1, column6). Then, continuing, next is the 2 cluster (row3, column1). Then, the 1 cluster (row7, column7). Then the 3 cluster (row9, column3). So the order would be8,2,1,3. But the output uses 8,2,3,1. So not matching.\n\nBut in Example1's input, scanning row-major:\n\nFirst cluster encountered is the8 cluster (row1, column8). Then the1 cluster (row3, column2). Then the2 cluster (row5, column7). Then the4 cluster (row9, column4). So order would be8,1,2,4. But the output's order is1,8,4,2. So not matching.\n\nHmm. This is getting a bit stuck. Let's think differently. Maybe each output row is formed by combining two different clusters. For example, the first two rows of the output are the first two clusters, and the last two rows are the other two. And within each pair, the clusters are ordered by their vertical position.\n\nIn Example0, the first two clusters (8 and2) are stacked horizontally in the output's first two rows, and the next two (3 and1) are stacked in the last two rows. But why would 3 come before1? Because3's top row is row9, which is below1's row7. So maybe the second pair is ordered by their vertical positions, but lower comes first? No. \n\nAlternatively, the clusters are ordered based on their top-left position's row and column. For Example0's clusters:\n\n-8: row1, column6\n\n-2: row3, column1\n\n-1: row7, column7\n\n-3: row9, column3\n\nOrdering by row and then column:\n\n1.8 (row1, column6)\n\n2.2 (row3, column1)\n\n3.1 (row7, column7)\n\n4.3 (row9, column3)\n\nBut the output order is8,2,3,1. So the third and fourth in this list are1 and3, but in the output they are3 and1. So perhaps after row7 and row9, the order is row7 comes first. So why would 3 (row9) come before1 (row7)? Doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother idea: the output's first two rows are the first two clusters encountered when scanning the input, and the next two rows are the last two clusters encountered. But in Example0, the order is8,2,3,1. The last two clusters encountered are3 and1. So perhaps the order is first two in the order encountered, then the last two in reverse order of encounter. So 3 and1 are encountered after 8 and2, but in the output they are ordered3,1. But that doesn't fit with Example1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output order is based on the cluster's number in some way. For Example0, the output order is8,2,3,1. 8 is the largest, then2, then3, then1. So largest to smallest. But in Example1, the output order is1,8,4,2. The numbers are1,8,4,2. Ordered largest to smallest would be8,4,2,1. But in Example1's output, it's1,8,4,2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the order is based on the sum of the cluster's numbers. But in Example0, sum of 8's cluster is 8+8+8+0=24, 2's cluster is 2+2+0+2=6,3's cluster is3+0+3+3=9,1's is0+1+1+1=3. Ordered by sum descending:8,3,2,1. Which matches Example0's output order 8,2,3,1? No, because 3's sum is9 and 2's is6. So sorted by sum descending would be8,3,2,1. But Example0's output is8,2,3,1. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the order is not based on the clusters' properties but their positions in the input. Let's think about the test input. The test input's clusters are:\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow2: 0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0 \u2192 columns3 has 6, columns10-11 have 8,8.\n\nRow3:0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0 \u2192 columns2-3 have6,6, and column11 has8.\n\nSo the 6 cluster is in rows2-3, columns2-3 and3-4 (maybe). Let's see:\n\nRow2: columns3 is6, row3: columns2-3 are6,6. So the 6 cluster is:\n\nRow2: columns3 \u21926\n\nRow3: columns2-3 \u21926,6\n\nRow3: column3 is6, row2: column3 is6.\n\nSo the 6 cluster is a 2x2 block:\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,6, ...] \u2192 column3 is6.\n\nRow3: [0,0,6,6, ...] \u2192 columns2 and3 are6 and6.\n\nSo the 2x2 cluster for6 is:\n\nRow2: columns3 \u21926\n\nRow3: columns2-3 \u21926,6.\n\nWait, maybe it's:\n\nRow2: columns3-4: 6 and0.\n\nRow3: columns2-3:6 and6.\n\nSo the cluster is:\n\nRow2: 6 0\n\nRow3:6 6\n\nSo the 6 cluster's 2x2 is:\n\n6 0\n\n6 6\n\nThen the8 cluster is in rows2-3, columns10-11:\n\nRow2: columns10-11:8,8.\n\nRow3: column11:8.\n\nSo the 8 cluster's 2x2:\n\nRow2:8,8\n\nRow3:0,8\n\nSo:\n\n8 8\n\n0 8\n\nThen there's the1 cluster in rows6-7, columns6-7:\n\nRow6: column6:1.\n\nRow7: columns6-7:1,1.\n\nSo the 1 cluster's 2x2 is:\n\nRow6:1 0\n\nRow7:1 1\n\nOr:\n\nRow6: column6 is1, others 0.\n\nRow7: columns6-7 are1,1.\n\nSo the cluster is:\n\nRow6:0,1 (if columns5-6?)\n\nWait, maybe the 1 cluster is:\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column6 is1.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns6-7 are1,1.\n\nSo the 1 cluster's 2x2 is:\n\nRow6 (columns6-7):1,0\n\nRow7 (columns6-7):1,1\n\nSo:\n\n1 0\n\n1 1\n\nThen the3 cluster is in rows9-10, columns2-3:\n\nRow9:0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 columns2-3 are3,3.\n\nRow10:0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 column2 is3.\n\nSo the3 cluster's 2x2 is:\n\nRow9:3,3\n\nRow10:3,0\n\nSo:\n\n3 3\n\n3 0\n\nNow, according to the pattern observed in the training examples, the output is formed by taking four 2x2 clusters from the input, ordered in a particular way, and concatenating their rows.\n\nIn the test input, the clusters are:\n\n- 6 cluster (rows2-3, columns2-3)\n\n-8 cluster (rows2-3, columns10-11)\n\n-1 cluster (rows6-7, columns6-7)\n\n-3 cluster (rows9-10, columns2-3)\n\nSo the four clusters are6,8,1,3.\n\nNow, the order in which these appear in the output must be determined. Looking at the training examples, the order in Example0 is8,2,3,1. Example1 is1,8,4,2. So perhaps the order is determined by the row where the cluster starts. For the test input:\n\n-6 cluster starts at row2.\n\n-8 cluster starts at row2.\n\n-1 cluster starts at row6.\n\n-3 cluster starts at row9.\n\nSo the order by starting row would be6,8 (both row2), then1 (row6), then3 (row9). But how to order clusters with the same starting row. For example,6 and8 both start at row2. Perhaps ordered by column. The6 cluster starts at column2 (row3, columns2-3), while the8 cluster starts at column10. So in row-major order, column2 comes before column10. So clusters starting at row2 would be ordered6 first, then8.\n\nSo the order would be6,8,1,3. Then the output would be formed by:\n\nFirst two clusters (6 and8) form the top half, with their rows concatenated.\n\nNext two clusters (1 and3) form the bottom half.\n\nBut let's check the training examples again. Example0's order is8,2,3,1. The first two are8 and2, which start at rows1 and3. So not same row. Example1's order is1,8,4,2. The first two start at row3 (1 cluster) and row1 (8 cluster). So no, the order is not based on row then column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is determined by the position of the cluster's top-left corner. For example, the earliest row, then earliest column. So for test input clusters:\n\n-6 cluster's top-left is row2, column3.\n\n-8 cluster's top-left is row2, column10.\n\n-1 cluster's top-left is row6, column6.\n\n-3 cluster's top-left is row9, column2.\n\nOrdering by row then column:\n\nrow2 clusters:6 (column3) and8 (column10). So 6 comes first.\n\nrow6:1 (column6)\n\nrow9:3 (column2)\n\nSo the order is6,8,1,3. \n\nBut in Example1's input clusters:\n\n-1 cluster's top-left is row3, column2.\n\n-8 cluster's top-left is row1, column8.\n\n-4 cluster's top-left is row9, column4.\n\n-2 cluster's top-left is row5, column7.\n\nSo order would be8 (row1),1 (row3),2 (row5),4 (row9). Which would make the order8,1,2,4. But Example1's output is1,8,4,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So maybe there's another way. Looking back at the training examples, the output orders seem to pair the first two clusters encountered in the input and the last two. But in the test input, perhaps the order is based on the order of the clusters' numbers. For example, the numbers in the test input are6,8,1,3. Numerically ordered, that's1,3,6,8. But the training examples don't follow numerical order. Example0's output is8,2,3,1, which is not numerical.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters are ordered based on their numerical value in reverse. So test input clusters:8,6,3,1. But Example0's output starts with8, which is the largest. Example1's output starts with1, which is the smallest, but then8, then4, then2. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the order is determined by the cluster's number in the output based on the following: the first two clusters are those that appear earlier in the input (rows), and the next two are later. For the test input, the order would be6,8 (row2), then1 (row6), then3 (row9). So the output would be the concatenation of these clusters' rows:\n\nFirst two rows of 6 and8 clusters:\n\n6 cluster's rows:\n\nRow2:6,0 (from columns3-4: wait, no, the 6 cluster is row2: column3 is6, row3: columns2-3 are6,6. So the 6 cluster's 2x2 is:\n\nRow2: columns2-3:0,6 (but row2's columns2 is0, column3 is6)\n\nRow3: columns2-3:6,6.\n\nSo the 2x2 cluster is:\n\n0 6\n\n6 6\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the test input's 6 cluster:\n\nIn row2: [0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0] \u2192 indexes 0-12. So columns3 (index3) is6.\n\nRow3: [0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0] \u2192 columns2 and3 (indexes2 and3) are6 and6.\n\nSo the 6 cluster's 2x2 block is:\n\nRow2 columns2-3:0,6\n\nRow3 columns2-3:6,6\n\nSo the cluster is:\n\n0 6\n\n6 6\n\nSimilarly, the8 cluster's 2x2 block is:\n\nRow2 columns10-11:8,8\n\nRow3 columns10-11:0,8 (assuming row3's column11 is8, column10 is0)\n\nSo:\n\n8 8\n\n0 8\n\nThe1 cluster is:\n\nRow6: columns6-7:1,0\n\nRow7: columns6-7:1,1\n\nSo:\n\n1 0\n\n1 1\n\nThe3 cluster is:\n\nRow9 columns2-3:3,3\n\nRow10 columns2-3:3,0\n\nSo:\n\n3 3\n\n3 0\n\nNow, if the order of clusters in the output is6,8,1,3, then the output would be:\n\nRow0: 0 6 | 8 8 \u2192 [0,6,8,8]\n\nRow1:6 6 |0 8 \u2192 [6,6,0,8]\n\nRow2:1 0 |3 3 \u2192 [1,0,3,3]\n\nRow3:1 1 |3 0 \u2192 [1,1,3,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output rows are merged. For example, in Example0, the first row is the first row of the8 cluster and first row of the2 cluster. But in the test input's clusters, the first two clusters are6 and8. So the first two output rows would combine their rows.\n\nBut the expected output might be different. However, the test input's output should follow the pattern of the training examples. Let's look at the training examples again.\n\nIn Example0's output, the first two rows are the first two clusters' rows merged. The clusters are8 and2. Their rows are:\n\n8 cluster:\n\nRow1:8,8\n\nRow2:8,0\n\n2 cluster:\n\nRow3:2,2\n\nRow4:0,2\n\nSo output rows:\n\n[8,8,2,2] \u2192 row0\n\n[8,0,0,2] \u2192 row1\n\nThen the next two clusters (3 and1) are merged similarly:\n\n3 cluster's rows:3,0 and3,3.\n\n1 cluster's rows:0,1 and1,1.\n\nSo output rows:\n\n[3,0,0,1] \u2192 row2\n\n[3,3,1,1] \u2192 row3\n\nThus, the output is formed by merging the first two clusters' rows horizontally, then the next two.\n\nBut the order of the clusters is crucial. For the test input, if the order is6,8,1,3, then the output would be:\n\nRow0:6 cluster row0 (0,6) +8 cluster row0 (8,8) \u2192 [0,6,8,8]\n\nRow1:6 cluster row1 (6,6) +8 cluster row1 (0,8) \u2192 [6,6,0,8]\n\nRow2:1 cluster row0 (1,0) +3 cluster row0 (3,3) \u2192 [1,0,3,3]\n\nRow3:1 cluster row1 (1,1) +3 cluster row1 (3,0) \u2192 [1,1,3,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' pattern. In the training examples, the clusters are ordered such that the first cluster's rows are on the left, and the second's on the right. But in the test input, the order would be6 and8 in the top, and1 and3 in the bottom.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the order of the clusters seems to vary. For example, in Example1, the order is1,8,4,2. So the first two clusters are1 and8, and their rows are merged. So the first output row is1,1,8,8 (row0 of1 cluster and row0 of8 cluster). The second row is1,0 (row1 of1 cluster) and0,8 (row1 of8 cluster) \u2192 [1,0,0,8]. Then the next two clusters are4 and2.\n\nIn the test input, if the order is6,8,1,3, then the output would be as above. But according to the pattern, maybe the order is different. Let's see:\n\nIn Example1's input, the output is1,8,4,2. So the first two clusters are1 and8, which have rows merged. The first cluster's rows are1,1 and1,0. The second's rows are8,8 and0,8. So merged as:\n\nRow0:1,1,8,8\n\nRow1:1,0,0,8\n\nThen the next two clusters are4 and2. Their rows are merged:\n\nRow0:4,0,2,2\n\nRow1:4,4,2,2\n\nSo output rows:\n\n[4,0,0,2]\n\n[4,4,2,2]\n\nThus, the order of clusters in Example1 is1,8,4,2.\n\nBut why this order? The clusters in the input are8,1,2,4. The order in the output is1,8,4,2. So perhaps the clusters are ordered by their numeric value in the output, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is determined by the position of the cluster's top-left corner, ordered by row first, then column. For Example1's clusters:\n\n-8 cluster: row1, column8.\n\n-1 cluster: row3, column2.\n\n-2 cluster: row5, column7.\n\n-4 cluster: row9, column4.\n\nOrdering by row and column: row1, column8 (8), then row3, column2 (1), then row5, column7 (2), then row9, column4 (4). So the order would be8,1,2,4. But the output order is1,8,4,2. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that the order may not be determined by row or column positions. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look for a pattern in the output numbers. In Example0's output:\n\nThe first two rows have 8s and2s. The last two have3s and1s. The numbers are arranged in a way that the output's first row combines the highest and next highest numbers. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters are ordered in the output based on their numbers' positions in some sequence. For example, in Example0's output, the numbers are8,2,3,1. These are the same as the cluster numbers. Perhaps the clusters are ordered based on the order in which their numbers first appear in the input. For example, in Example0's input, the first cluster is8, then2, then1, then3. But the output order is8,2,3,1. So the first three clusters are in the order they appear, but then3 comes before1. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the order is based on the sum of the cluster's digits. For Example0's clusters:\n\n8 sum is8, 2 is2,3 is3,1 is1. Ordered as8,3,2,1. But output is8,2,3,1. So no.\n\nAnother approach: in both training examples, the output's first two clusters are the ones in the upper part of the input. For Example0,8 and2 are in upper part (rows1-4). Example1's first two are1 and8 (rows1-4). Then the next two clusters are in the lower part of the input. For Example0,3 and1 are in rows9 and7. For Example1,4 and2 are in rows9 and5. So maybe the order is upper clusters first, then lower clusters. Within upper and lower, ordered by row.\n\nIn Example0's upper clusters:8 (row1),2 (row3) \u2192 ordered by row:8,2.\n\nLower clusters:3 (row9),1 (row7) \u2192 ordered by row:1 comes first (row7), then3 (row9). But in the output, it's3,1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, lower clusters are ordered by row in reverse. So row9 comes before row7. But that's not intuitive.\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the pattern is that the output is formed by taking four 2x2 clusters from the input, ordered based on the cluster's number in ascending order, and then arranging them in a specific way.\n\nBut the training examples don't support this. For example, Example0's output order is8,2,3,1, which isn't ascending.\n\nGiven that this is a puzzle competition, perhaps the pattern is to identify that each output row is formed by taking the first row of each cluster in the order they appear, and then the second row. But in Example0's output, the first two rows are from the first two clusters, and the last two rows from the last two clusters.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the four clusters and rotating each of them 90 degrees clockwise, then combining them into a 4x4 grid.\n\nBut in Example0's 8 cluster:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n8 8\n\n8 0\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise:\n\n8 8\n\n0 8\n\nWhich matches the first two rows of the output.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 cluster:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n2 2\n\n0 2\n\nRotated 90 degrees:\n\n0 2\n\n2 2\n\nBut in the output, the 2 cluster's rows are placed as 2,2 in the first row and 0,2 in the second. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each cluster is transposed. Transposing the 8 cluster would give:\n\n8 8\n\n8 0 \u2192 transpose \u2192 8 8\n\n           8 0\n\nSo transpose would not change anything. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters are rotated 180 degrees. For the 8 cluster:\n\n8 8 \u2192 becomes 0 8\n\n8 0 \u2192      8 8\n\nBut that doesn't fit the output.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters are flipped vertically. For the 8 cluster:\n\nOriginal:\n\n8 8\n\n8 0\n\nFlipped vertically:\n\n8 0\n\n8 8\n\nWhich matches the output's first two rows (8,8,2,2 and 8,0,0,2). So the first row of the output is the flipped 8 cluster's first row (8,8) and the flipped 2 cluster's first row (2,2). So perhaps each cluster is flipped vertically, and then their rows are concatenated.\n\nLet's check Example0:\n\n8 cluster flipped vertically:\n\n8 0\n\n8 8\n\n2 cluster flipped vertically:\n\n0 2\n\n2 2\n\nSo the top two rows of the output are:\n\n8 0 | 0 2 \u2192 but the output's first row is8,8,2,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nAnother observation: in both training examples, the output's first two rows have the cluster numbers in the first part (left) and the next cluster in the right. For Example0:\n\nFirst two rows are 8 and2 clusters.\n\nThen the next two are3 and1.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1:\n\nFirst two rows are1 and8.\n\nThen next two are4 and2.\n\nSo the order of the first two clusters in the output can vary. In Example0, it's8 and2. In Example1, it's1 and8. So the order of the first two clusters isn't fixed. \n\nBut how to determine which comes first in the output. Let's look at the clusters' positions:\n\nIn Example0, the8 cluster is in the upper part (row1), and the2 cluster is also in the upper part (row3). The1 cluster is lower (row7), and3 is even lower (row9). So the first two clusters are in the upper part, the next two in the lower.\n\nIn Example1, the first two clusters are1 (row3) and8 (row1), which are both in the upper part. The next two are4 (row9) and2 (row5), which are lower.\n\nSo perhaps the first two clusters are the first two encountered in the input when scanning top to bottom. In Example0,8 comes first (row1), then2 (row3), so output order is8,2. In Example1,1 comes first in row3, but8 is in row1. So when scanning top to bottom, the first cluster encountered is8 (row1), then1 (row3). But the output order is1,8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting quite stuck. Perhaps the key is that the output is the four 2x2 clusters from the input, ordered based on their position when the input is divided into four quadrants. For example, each cluster is in one quadrant of the input, and the output quadrants correspond to the input quadrants. But the input is 13x13. The quadrants would be:\n\nTop-left: rows0-6, columns0-6\n\nTop-right: rows0-6, columns7-12\n\nBottom-left: rows7-12, columns0-6\n\nBottom-right: rows7-12, columns7-12\n\nSo each cluster is assigned to a quadrant based on its position. Then, the output is formed by arranging the clusters from each quadrant in the order top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.\n\nIn Example0:\n\n-8 cluster is in rows1-2, columns6-7. Columns6-7 is on the boundary between top-left and top-right. Column6 is top-left (if columns0-6 are top-left), column7 is top-right. So the8 cluster spans the boundary. \n\nBut perhaps it's considered to be in the top-right quadrant (columns7-12). So in the output's top-right quadrant.\n\nThe2 cluster is in rows3-4, columns1-2 \u2192 top-left quadrant.\n\nThe3 cluster is in rows9-10, columns3-4 \u2192 bottom-left quadrant.\n\nThe1 cluster is in rows7-8, columns7-8 \u2192 bottom-right quadrant.\n\nSo the output would arrange the quadrants as:\n\nTop-left (2 cluster) \u2192 output's top-left.\n\nTop-right (8 cluster) \u2192 output's top-right.\n\nBottom-left (3 cluster) \u2192 output's bottom-left.\n\nBottom-right (1 cluster) \u2192 output's bottom-right.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nFirst two rows: 2 cluster and8 cluster merged.\n\nLast two rows:3 cluster and1 cluster merged.\n\nWhich would be:\n\n[2,2,8,8]\n\n[0,2,0,8]\n\n[3,0,0,1]\n\n[3,3,1,1]\n\nBut the actual output in Example0 is:\n\n[8,8,2,2]\n\n[8,0,0,2]\n\n[3,0,0,1]\n\n[3,3,1,1]\n\nWhich doesn't match. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the output is ordered based on the quadrant's position in a different manner. Maybe the output's order is top-right, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-left. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the clusters in the order of their positions in the input's columns. For Example0:\n\nThe8 cluster is in columns6-7 (center-right), the2 cluster is in columns1-2 (left), the3 cluster in columns3-4 (left-center), the1 cluster in columns7-8 (right). Ordered left to right, the clusters would be2 (columns1-2),3 (3-4),8 (6-7),1 (7-8). So output order would be2,3,8,1. But Example0's output is8,2,3,1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the complexity of the problem, I think the best approach is to assume that the output is formed by taking four 2x2 clusters from the input, ordered based on the first occurrence of their cluster number in the input, and then arranging their rows in the output by concatenating the first two clusters' rows and then the next two. However, the exact order remains unclear. \n\nLooking at the test input, the clusters are6,8,1,3. In the input, the order of their first occurrence is:\n\n-6 appears first in row2.\n\n-8 appears first in row2 as well.\n\n-1 appears in row6.\n\n-3 appears in row9.\n\nSo the first two clusters are6 and8, but in which order? If ordered by column,6 is in columns3 and8 in columns10. So 6 comes first. Then8, then1, then3. \n\nSo the output would be:\n\nFirst two rows from6 and8 clusters:\n\n6 cluster's rows:\n\n0 6\n\n6 6\n\n8 cluster's rows:\n\n8 8\n\n0 8\n\nSo merged as:\n\n[0,6,8,8]\n\n[6,6,0,8]\n\nThen the next two clusters:1 and3.\n\n1 cluster's rows:\n\n1 0\n\n1 1\n\n3 cluster's rows:\n\n3 3\n\n3 0\n\nMerged as:\n\n[1,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,3,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,6,8,8]\n\n[6,6,0,8]\n\n[1,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,3,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' style. For example, the numbers in the output are arranged with the first cluster's numbers first. However, in the training examples, the output's first row starts with the first cluster's first row followed by the second cluster's first row. But if the first two clusters are6 and8, the first row would be6's first row and8's first row. \n\nIn the test input's case,6's first row is0,6, and8's first row is8,8. So merged as0,6,8,8. But the training examples have the first cluster's first row followed by the second cluster's first row. For Example0,8 and2 clusters' first rows are8,8 and2,2, merged as8,8,2,2. So the order is correct.\n\nThus, the test input's output should be:\n\nFirst two clusters:6 and8. Merged rows:\n\nRow0:0,6,8,8\n\nRow1:6,6,0,8\n\nNext two clusters:1 and3. Merged rows:\n\nRow2:1,0,3,3\n\nRow3:1,1,3,0\n\nBut looking at the training examples' outputs, in Example0's output, the third and fourth rows are3,0,0,1 and3,3,1,1. Which are merged from3 and1 clusters. So for test input, the third and fourth rows would be from1 and3 clusters. But in the test input, the clusters are1 and3. So merging their rows would give:\n\n1 cluster's rows:\n\n1 0\n\n1 1\n\n3 cluster's rows:\n\n3 3\n\n3 0\n\nSo merged as:\n\nRow2:1,0,3,3\n\nRow3:1,1,3,0\n\nWhich matches what I have above.\n\nBut the training examples have different ordering for the third and fourth clusters. For example, in Example0, the third and fourth clusters are3 and1. Merged as3's rows and1's rows.\n\nBut according to the test input's order, if the clusters are1 and3, merged as1 then3, the output rows would be:\n\nRow2:1,0,3,3\n\nRow3:1,1,3,0\n\nBut according to the pattern in the training examples, the order of the third and fourth clusters might vary. Alternatively, the order of all four clusters is determined by their first occurrence in the input. In the test input, the order would be6,8,1,3. So the first two clusters are6 and8, next are1 and3. Merged as such.\n\nBut looking at Example1's output, the third and fourth clusters are4 and2. The order is4 then2, which corresponds to their order in the input (4 appears at row9, 2 at row5). So the order seems to be based on first occurrence. In Example1, the order is1 (row3),8 (row1),4 (row9),2 (row5). So the order is not based on row order, but on first occurrence. Because 8 appears in row1 (earlier than1's row3), but in the output,1 comes first. This contradicts the earlier assumption.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed with the initial assumption that the output is formed by taking the four 2x2 clusters from the input, ordered based on their first occurrence in the input (row-major order), merged in pairs. For the test input, the order is6,8,1,3. So the output would be as follows:\n\n6 cluster's rows:\n\nRow2:0,6\n\nRow3:6,6\n\n8 cluster's rows:\n\nRow2:8,8\n\nRow3:0,8\n\nMerging the first two rows:\n\nRow0:0,6,8,8\n\nRow1:6,6,0,8\n\nThen 1 and3 clusters:\n\n1 cluster's rows:\n\nRow6:1,0\n\nRow7:1,1\n\n3 cluster's rows:\n\nRow9:3,3\n\nRow10:3,0\n\nMerging:\n\nRow2:1,0,3,3\n\nRow3:1,1,3,0\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the third and fourth rows in Example0 and Example1 have zeros in the middle. For instance, in Example0's output, the third row is [3,0,0,1]. In the test input's case, merging1 and3 clusters would give:\n\nRow2:1,0,3,3 \u2192 this has no zeros in the middle. Hmm. So this doesn't match the training examples' pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the order of the third and fourth clusters is reversed. For the test input, perhaps the third and fourth clusters are3 and1, not1 and3. Let's see:\n\nIf the order is6,8,3,1, then:\n\nThird and fourth clusters are3 and1.\n\n3 cluster's rows:\n\n3,3\n\n3,0\n\n1 cluster's rows:\n\n1,0\n\n1,1\n\nMerged as:\n\nRow2:3,3,1,0 \u2192 [3,3,1,0]\n\nRow3:3,0,1,1 \u2192 [3,0,1,1]\n\nBut this doesn't fit the training examples' pattern where the third row has zeros in the middle. For example, in Example0's third row is3,0,0,1. The zeros are between3 and1. In the test input's case, if the third row is3,3,1,0, there are no zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters are ordered such that the third and fourth are sorted by their numbers. In the test input,3 and1 would be ordered1,3. So merging1's rows and3's rows:\n\nRow2:1,0,3,3\n\nRow3:1,1,3,0\n\nWhich is what we had before.\n\nBut this still doesn't match the training examples' pattern of having zeros in the middle of the third row. \n\nPerhaps the test input's output should have the same structure as the training examples, where the third row has two zeros between the clusters. For that to happen, the third and fourth clusters must have rows with zeros. Let's look at the test input's clusters:\n\n1 cluster's rows:\n\n1 0\n\n1 1\n\n3 cluster's rows:\n\n3 3\n\n3 0\n\nMerging these as1 then3:\n\nRow2:1,0,3,3\n\nRow3:1,1,3,0\n\nThis doesn't have zeros in between. So this doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the clusters are ordered based on the highest number first. So for the test input's clusters:8,6,3,1. Merging8 and6, then3 and1.\n\nBut let's see:\n\n8 cluster's rows:\n\n8,8\n\n0,8\n\n6 cluster's rows:\n\n0,6\n\n6,6\n\nMerging8 and6:\n\nRow0:8,8,0,6 \u2192 [8,8,0,6]\n\nRow1:0,8,6,6 \u2192 [0,8,6,6]\n\nThen3 and1:\n\n3 cluster's rows:\n\n3,3\n\n3,0\n\n1 cluster's rows:\n\n1,0\n\n1,1\n\nMerged as:\n\nRow2:3,3,1,0\n\nRow3:3,0,1,1\n\nBut this also doesn't fit the training examples' pattern. \n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the training examples. The test input's output should have four rows, each with four elements, combining the four 2x2 clusters in some order. Based on the training examples, the clusters might be ordered based on their positions in the input such that the first two are from the upper part and the next two from the lower part, but the exact order is unclear. \n\nLooking at the test input, the clusters are6,8,1,3. Perhaps the order is based on the cluster's number's position in the input. The first cluster encountered is6, then8, then1, then3. So the output would merge6 and8, then1 and3. \n\nAlternatively, the order might be8,6,1,3, but this is speculative. \n\nGiven that the training examples' outputs start with the highest number (Example0 starts with8, Example1 starts with1), perhaps there's no fixed order, but the test input's output should start with the highest number, which is8. \n\nSo the test input's clusters are6,8,1,3. The highest number is8. So the first two clusters would be8 and6. Then1 and3. \n\nBut this is not supported by the training examples. For instance, Example1's output starts with1, which is not the highest in that case. \n\nGiven the time I've invested and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial approach of ordering the clusters based on their first occurrence in row-major order. For the test input, the order is6,8,1,3. Thus, the output would be:\n\n[0,6,8,8]\n\n[6,6,0,8]\n\n[1,0,3,3]\n\n[1,1,3,0]\n\nHowever, this doesn't match the training examples' format, where the third row has zeros in the middle. For example, in Example0's output, the third row is[3,0,0,1], which has two zeros between3 and1. So perhaps the order of clusters in the third and fourth positions is reversed. \n\nIf the order is6,8,3,1, then the output would be:\n\nRow0:0,6,3,3 \u2192 but this would be merging6 and3, which doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, after the first two clusters (6 and8), the next two are3 and1. Merging their rows:\n\n3 cluster's rows:3,3 and3,0\n\n1 cluster's rows:1,0 and1,1\n\nMerged as:\n\nRow2:3,3,1,0 \u2192 [3,3,1,0]\n\nRow3:3,0,1,1 \u2192 [3,0,1,1]\n\nThis also doesn't match the training examples' pattern. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial answer based on the first occurrence order.",
