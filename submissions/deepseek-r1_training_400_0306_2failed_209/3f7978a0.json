        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking closely at the examples to identify any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input is a 9x9 grid, and the output is a 5x5 grid. The output rows are [8,0,0,0,8], [5,0,0,0,5], [5,0,8,0,5], etc. Hmm. I notice that in the input, the non-zero numbers might be forming some kind of symmetric pattern. Let's check the positions of the 8s and 5s in the input.\n\nIn the first row of input Example 0, all are zeros except the second, sixth, and ninth elements are 8. But the output's first row is [8,0,0,0,8]. Maybe the output is taking the first and last non-zero elements of each row? Wait, but in the input rows, sometimes there are multiple non-zero numbers. For instance, the second input row is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. The non-zero positions here are 1,5,8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based index? Let's check. If it's 0-based, positions 1,5,8. The output row is [8,0,0,0,8]. So maybe the first and last non-zero in the row are taken, and the middle ones are filled with zeros. But how does that create a 5-element row? The original row has 9 elements. So maybe the output is taking the first and last non-zero elements from each input row, but how does that condense into a shorter array?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is focusing on the center of the input grid. For example, in a 9x9 grid, the center is at position (4,4), maybe the output is a 5x5 grid centered around that. But looking at Example 0's input, the third row of the output is [5,0,8,0,5]. The input's third row is [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0]. The middle element here is the fifth (0-based index 4), which is 0, but the output's middle element is 8. Wait, maybe looking at the entire grid, there's a diamond or cross pattern. Let me check the input grid for Example 0.\n\nLooking at the input rows of Example 0:\n\nRow 0: all zeros except positions 1,5,8 (but these are 8s? Wait, original input for Example 0's input is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8 \u2192 positions 1,5,8 (8s).\n\nRow 2: 0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0 \u2192 positions 1 and 5 (5s).\n\nRow 3: 0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0 \u2192 positions 1 (5), 3 (8), 5 (5), 7 (8).\n\nRow 4: same as row 2.\n\nRow 5: similar to row 1 but ends with 0,0,0.\n\nWait, the output for Example 0 is 5 rows. Each output row has 5 elements. Let me see if the output rows correspond to certain rows in the input. The output rows might be the middle rows of the input. For a 9x9 grid, rows 0-8, so middle rows are 4. But the output has 5 rows, so maybe rows 1-5? Or perhaps it's centered. Let's check the output rows:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\nLooking at these, they seem symmetric. Each starts and ends with the same number, and the middle elements are zeros except the middle row which has an 8. Let's see if in the input grid, the positions of the numbers form a diamond or cross. For example, in the input rows, maybe each output row is formed by taking the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth elements (for a 9-element row) but that would give 5 elements. Wait, the input rows have 9 elements, so if we take every other element starting from index 0, that would be 0,2,4,6,8. For example, row 1 of input is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. Taking indices 0,2,4,6,8: 0,0,0,0,8. But the output row is [8,0,0,0,8]. Hmm, that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth elements are taken in reverse. Wait, index 0 is first, index 8 is last. For row 1, taking elements at positions 0,2,4,6,8: 0,0,0,0,8. But the output row is [8,0,0,0,8], which is reversed. So maybe they are reversed? But that's a stretch. Let's check another row. Take input row 3: [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0]. Taking positions 0,2,4,6,8: 0,0,0,0,0. But output row for that is [5,0,8,0,5]. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is a cross-section of the input. For example, the output is formed by the non-zero elements arranged in a certain pattern. Looking at Example 0's output, each row has 8s or 5s at the ends. The 8s might come from rows that have 8s in the input, and 5s from rows with 5s. For example, the first output row is [8,0,0,0,8], which could correspond to the input rows that have 8s. Let's check input rows 1,5,7,8. But the output has 5 rows, so maybe each output row is a combination of certain input rows. Alternatively, each output row corresponds to a specific input row. For example, the first output row corresponds to input row 1, which starts and ends with 8. But input row 1 is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8], so the first non-zero is 8 at position 1, then 8 at position 5, then 8 at position 8. The output row has 8 at first and last positions. So maybe for each input row, the output row is [first non-zero, 0,0,0, last non-zero]. But what if there are multiple non-zero elements?\n\nIn input row 1: first non-zero is 8 (position 1), last non-zero is 8 (position 8). So output row is [8, 0,0,0,8]. That matches the first output row of Example 0.\n\nInput row 2: first non-zero is 5 (position 1), last non-zero is 5 (position 5). So output would be [5,0,0,0,5]. Which matches the second output row.\n\nRow 3 of input has first non-zero 5 (position 1), then 8 (position3), then 5 (position5), then 8 (position7). The output row is [5,0,8,0,5]. Wait, but the middle element here is 8, which is the third non-zero in the input row. How does that fit? So perhaps the output row is constructed by taking the first, middle, and last non-zero elements of the input row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a diamond shape where the non-zero elements in the input are arranged in a way that when centered, their positions form the output. For example, in the input grid of Example 0, the 8s might form a diamond pattern when viewed from the center. Let's imagine the input grid as a 9x9 grid. The center is at (4,4). Let's see where the 8s and 5s are.\n\nLooking at input rows:\n\nRow 1 (index 1): columns 1,5,8 have 8s.\n\nRow 3: columns 1 (5), 3 (8), 5 (5), 7 (8).\n\nRow 5: columns 1 and5 (8s).\n\nRow 7: columns 3 and7 (8s).\n\nRow 8: column1 (8).\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think of another angle. The output grids in the examples have varying sizes. For example, Example 0's output is 5x5, Example 1's output is 5x7, and Example 2's output is 6x5. So the size of the output depends on the input. But how?\n\nAnother observation: the outputs are symmetrical. Each row is a palindrome. For example, in Example 0's output, each row is the same forwards and backwards. So the pattern must create a symmetrical output.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The output is 5x7. The rows are [8,0,0,0,0,0,8], [5,0,0,0,0,0,5], etc. So each row starts and ends with the same number (8 or 5) and has zeros in between. The middle element might be another 8 or 5. For example, in the third output row of Example 1: [5,0,0,8,8,0,5]. Wait, the middle elements are 8 and 8. So perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the first non-zero, then the next non-zero in the middle, and the last non-zero, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from each row in the input, and arranging them in a way that creates a symmetrical pattern. For example, if a row in the input has non-zero elements at certain positions, those are mirrored in the output row. Let's take Example 0's input row 3: [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0]. The non-zero elements are 5,8,5,8. The output row is [5,0,8,0,5]. So perhaps the output takes the first, third, and fifth non-zero elements (assuming some symmetry). Wait, the first non-zero is 5, then 8, then 5, then 8. The output is [5,0,8,0,5]. So it's taking the first, third, and fifth positions? But there are only four non-zero elements here. That doesn't add up.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the central part of the input grid where non-zero elements are concentrated. For instance, in Example 0's input, the non-zero elements form a diamond or cross in the center. If you extract a 5x5 grid around the center, that might form the output. Let's check. The input is 9x9. The center is at (4,4). Taking rows 2 to 6 and columns 2 to 6 (assuming 0-based), which would give a 5x5 grid. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input rows 2-6 (indices 2 to 6):\n\nRow 2: [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 2-6: 0,0,0,5,0 \u2192 no, that's not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe taking the middle row and some around. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by collapsing each input row into a row where only the first and last non-zero elements are kept, and the middle elements are zeros. For example, in a row with multiple non-zeros, the output row has the first and last non-zero, with zeros in between. But how does the length of the output row get determined?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output rows, each has length 5. The input rows are length 9. So perhaps the output rows are taking every other element. For example, 9 elements would become 5 by taking elements at positions 0,2,4,6,8. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 1: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. Taking every other element starting from index 0: 0,0,0,0,8. But the output is [8,0,0,0,8]. So that doesn't fit. Unless we take from the end. If we reverse the row and take every other element starting from 0, then reverse again. Let's see:\n\nRow 1 reversed: [8,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Taking elements 0,2,4,6,8: 8,0,0,0,0 \u2192 reversed back gives [0,0,0,0,8], which is not the output. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the position of the non-zero elements in the input and see how they map to the output.\n\nTake Example 0's input row 1: positions 1,5,8 are 8s. The output row is [8,0,0,0,8]. So perhaps the first and last elements of the output row correspond to the first and last non-zero in the input row, and the middle elements are zeros. But how does the output row length relate to the input row length? The input has 9 elements, output has 5. Maybe the output row length is (input row length +1)/2, which for 9 is 5. So perhaps for each input row, the output row is formed by taking the elements at positions 0, 2,4,6,8 (even indices). Let's check that.\n\nFor Example 0 input row 1: elements at even indices (0,2,4,6,8) are 0,0,0,0,8 \u2192 output is [8,0,0,0,8]. Doesn't match. So maybe the output is reversed. Taking those elements and reversing gives [8,0,0,0,0], which is also not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each input row, the output row is created by taking the first non-zero element, then the middle non-zero elements, then the last non-zero element. For example, if the input row has non-zeros at positions 1,5,8, the output would take 8 (first), then 5 (middle?), then 8 (last). But that would give a 3-element row. But the output has 5 elements. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, each row starts and ends with the same number. The middle element is sometimes non-zero, like in the third row: [5,0,8,0,5]. So maybe for each input row, the output row is formed by taking the first non-zero, then the middle non-zero (if any), then the last non-zero, and padding with zeros to create a palindrome. But how?\n\nLooking at input row 3 (Example 0): [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0]. The non-zeros are at positions 1 (5), 3 (8), 5 (5), 7 (8). The output row is [5,0,8,0,5]. So the first non-zero is 5, last is 5 (position5?), and the middle non-zero is 8. But how to determine which middle element to pick.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is the first non-zero, followed by the middle non-zero elements in order, then the last non-zero. But the output row has 5 elements. For input row 3, there are four non-zeros. So maybe the output row takes the first, third, and fifth non-zeros (but there are only four). That doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a mirror of the first half of the input row. For example, for a 9-element row, the first 5 elements are taken and mirrored. Let's see:\n\nInput row 1: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. First five elements: 0,8,0,0,0. Mirroring would give [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0], but that's not helpful. The output row is [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output rows are constructed by taking the first and last non-zero elements of the input row, and the middle element of the input row. For example, input row 1 has first non-zero at position 1 (8), last at position8 (8), and the middle element (position4) is 0. So the output row would be [8, 0, 0, 0, 8], which matches. Input row 3: first non-zero is 5 at position1, last non-zero is 8 at position7. Middle element of the row is position4 (0). But the output row is [5,0,8,0,5]. Wait, the middle element here is 8. How does that fit?\n\nWait, in input row 3 of Example0, the non-zeros are at positions1,3,5,7. So maybe the output row is formed by the first non-zero (5), the third non-zero (5 again?), but no. Wait, input row3's non-zeros: 5 (pos1),8(pos3),5(pos5),8(pos7). So four non-zeros. The output row is [5,0,8,0,5]. So first and last are 5, middle is 8. So maybe it's taking the first non-zero, the middle non-zero (if even number, perhaps the left middle?), then the last non-zero. For four non-zeros, the middle would be the second and third. So maybe in this case, the middle of the non-zeros is 8 (pos3) and 5 (pos5). But the output picks 8. So perhaps the middle element of the output is the middle of the input row's non-zero elements. For even numbers, maybe the left one. So in this case, four non-zeros: middle would be the second and third elements (8 and5). Then perhaps take the left one (8), which is what the output shows. So the output is [first, 0, middle_non-zero, 0, last]. That could explain Example0's row3 output.\n\nSo, the pattern for each row could be:\n\n- For each input row, identify all non-zero elements in order.\n\n- The output row is formed by taking the first non-zero, then if there's an odd number of non-zeros, the middle one, then the last non-zero. For even numbers, perhaps take the one before the middle.\n\nWait, but in Example0's row1 input, the non-zeros are 8,8,8 (positions1,5,8). So three non-zeros. The output row is [8,0,0,0,8]. Wait, the middle non-zero is 8. So why is the output's middle element 0? That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row is only the first and last non-zero elements of the input row, and the middle elements are zeros. So for any input row, regardless of how many non-zeros, the output row is [first_non-zero, 0, ..., last_non-zero], with zeros in between. Then how to determine the length of the output row.\n\nWait, in Example0's input rows are length9, output rows are length5. Example1's input rows are length11, output rows length7. Example2's input rows are length13, output rows are length5. Wait, no: Example1's output is 5 rows each of length7. So the output row length is (input row length +1)/2. For input row length9, (9+1)/2=5, which matches. For input row length11, (11+1)/2=6, but Example1's output rows are length7. Wait, no. Maybe the output row length is the input row length minus 4. For example, 9-4=5, 11-4=7. Yes! 9-4=5, 11-4=7, 13-4=9. But in Example2's output, the rows are length5, but the input rows are length13. 13-4=9. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, the output row length is the input row length minus twice some value. Not sure.\n\nLooking back at Example0's input rows: each is length9. Output rows are length5. 5 is (9//2)+1. Similarly, in Example1, input rows length11, output rows length7. 11//2=5.5, so 5.5+1=6.5, but 7 is the output. Maybe ceil(input_length/2). For 9: ceil(9/2)=5, which matches. 11: ceil(11/2)=6, but Example1's output rows are length7. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row length is determined by the number of non-zero elements in the input row. For example, in Example0's input row1, there are three 8s. The output row is length5, which is more than three. So that's not directly related.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the Test Input. The test input is a 14-row grid, each row has 13 elements. Let's see the expected output. The training examples' outputs have varying sizes. So perhaps the output is generated by taking certain columns and rows from the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by extracting rows and columns where non-zero elements form a diamond pattern. For example, the output is the central diamond-shaped area of non-zero elements. Let's check Example0's input. The non-zero elements form a diamond. For instance, rows 1,3,5,7 have 8s and 5s arranged in a way that the output is a diamond. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's input, the 8s are positioned such that they form a diamond when connected. For example:\n\nRow1: 8s at positions1,5,8.\n\nRow3: 8s at positions3,7.\n\nRow5: 8s at positions1,5.\n\nRow7: 8s at positions3,7.\n\nRow8: 8 at position1.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAnother observation: the output rows in the examples have varying numbers of rows. For example, Example0's output has5 rows, Example1 has5 rows, Example2 has6 rows. So the number of output rows may correspond to the number of rows in the input that contain non-zero elements. Wait, Example0's input has 9 rows. The output has5 rows. Example1's input has9 rows, output 5. Wait, no. Example1's input has9 rows, output 5 rows. Example2's input has 11 rows, output6 rows. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nLet's think of the output as a compressed version of the input, where each row is reduced by taking the first and last non-zero elements, and possibly the middle ones. For example:\n\nFor each input row:\n\n- Ignore leading and trailing zeros.\n\n- The remaining elements form a sequence. The output row is this sequence mirrored, or padded with zeros to create a symmetrical pattern.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the input, the output row is the minimal palindrome that can be formed from the non-zero elements. For example, in Example0's row1: 8,8,8 \u2192 palindrome is 8,8,8. But the output is 8,0,0,0,8. Which is a palindrome but has zeros in the middle.\n\nWait, that's not matching. So maybe the output is a palindrome where the first and last elements are the first and last non-zero elements of the input row, and the middle elements are zeros. For example, if the input row has non-zeros a, b, c, the output would be [a, 0, b, 0, a] if even length, or something like that. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first and last non-zero elements of each row, with zeros in between, and the length of the output row is determined by the maximum distance between the first and last non-zero elements in any row. For example, if a row has first non-zero at position1 and last at position8, the distance is 7, so the output row length would be 7+1=8. But in Example0, the output rows are length5. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are all the same length, but that's not the case in the examples. Example2's output has rows of length5, Example1's are length7.\n\nMaybe each output row corresponds to a specific pattern in the input rows. For example, in Example0's output, the rows are 5 long, which is the same as the number of non-zero elements in certain rows. But no.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the columns of the input and output. For Example0's input, the output columns are 5. Maybe the output is formed by taking the central columns of the input. For example, in a 9-column input, the central 5 columns (columns 2-6) might form the output. Let's check:\n\nExample0 input row1: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. Columns 2-6: 0,0,0,8,0 \u2192 but output row is [8,0,0,0,8]. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, columns 0,2,4,6,8. For row1, these are 0,0,0,0,8 \u2192 output is [8,0,0,0,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe this is a dead end.\n\nLet's think of the output as the sum or some other operation of the input's rows. For example, for each output row, the elements are the non-zero elements from the corresponding input row, arranged in a symmetrical way. So, if the input row has non-zeros, the output row starts and ends with those, with zeros in between. For example:\n\nInput row: 0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8 \u2192 non-zeros are 8,8,8. Output row is [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nBut why not [8,8,8] padded to 5 elements? Because the output rows are all the same length for each example. For example0, all output rows are length5.\n\nWait, the output rows have varying numbers of elements. Example0's output is 5x5, Example1's is 5x7, Example2's is6x5. So the output dimensions vary. So the number of rows and columns in the output depends on the input's structure.\n\nAnother observation: in each example, the output rows alternate between 8s and 5s. Like in Example0, the first and last rows are 8s, the middle rows are 5s. Similarly, Example1 has 8s, then 5s, etc. This suggests that the output rows are grouped by the type of number (8 and5), perhaps forming a shape where 8s outline and 5s are inside.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0:8,0,0,0,8\n\nRow1:5,0,0,0,5\n\nRow2:5,0,8,0,5\n\nRow3:5,0,0,0,5\n\nRow4:8,0,0,0,8\n\nSo the output is a diamond shape with 8s at the corners and top/bottom, 5s forming a diamond inside, with a central 8.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input? The input must have these numbers arranged in a way that when processed, they form such a pattern.\n\nLooking at the input for Example0, the 8s are in the first, fifth, and eighth positions of certain rows, and the 5s are in other positions. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of these numbers in the input and centering them.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a matrix where each cell (i,j) corresponds to the sum of certain elements in the input matrix. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input and arranging them in a diamond pattern. For example, the output's rows correspond to the rows in the input that have non-zero elements, and the columns are determined by their positions. But it's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input. The test input is a 14-row grid, each row has 13 elements. The output should follow the pattern from the examples. Let's see if we can find a pattern between the input and output of the examples to apply to the test.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nInput rows where the first non-zero is 8 or 5. The output rows start with that number and end with it. So the pattern is for each input row, the output row starts and ends with the first and last non-zero of that input row, with zeros in between, forming a palindrome. The length of the output row is the number of elements between the first and last non-zero (inclusive) plus some factor. But how to determine the length.\n\nAlternatively, for each input row, the output row is a palindrome where the first and last elements are the first and last non-zero elements of the input row. The middle elements are the non-zero elements between them, padded with zeros to form a symmetrical pattern.\n\nFor example, in input row3 of Example0: non-zeros are 5,8,5,8. So output row is [5,0,8,0,5]. But why the middle element is 8 and not the other 5 and8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is formed by taking the first non-zero, then the non-zero elements in the reverse order, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is the first non-zero, followed by the non-zero elements in reverse order excluding the last, then the last non-zero. For example, input row3 non-zeros:5,8,5,8. Output would be 5,8,5,8,5. But the output row is [5,0,8,0,5], which is different.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, the output grid is a diamond shape, with numbers 8 and5 forming concentric diamonds. The 8s are on the outer layers, and the 5s inside, and sometimes an 8 in the center. The output's number of rows depends on how many layers there are.\n\nFor Example0's output, it's a diamond with 5 rows. The layers are:\n\nRow0:8...\n\nRow1:5...\n\nRow2:5...\n\nRow3:5...\n\nRow4:8...\n\nBut the third row has an 8 in the center. So maybe the input's non-zero elements form such a diamond, and the output is that diamond extracted.\n\nSo the pattern could be: identify the diamond-shaped region in the input grid where non-zero elements are present, and extract that as the output.\n\nBut how to determine the diamond shape.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the largest possible diamond that can be formed from the input's non-zero elements. For example, the diamond's size is determined by the maximum number of layers around the center.\n\nBut how to map that to the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the central part of the input where the non-zero elements form a diamond. For instance, the output is centered at the middle of the input grid, and the size is such that it captures all the non-zero elements in a diamond pattern.\n\nBut this would require knowing the center of the input grid and the maximum distance of non-zero elements from the center.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input, the center is at (4,4). Let's see which non-zero elements are around it. Row3, column3:8, which is the center. The output has a central 8. So perhaps the output is a diamond where each layer corresponds to the non-zero elements at a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I'm spending and not finding a clear pattern, maybe I should try to reverse-engineer the test input.\n\nThe test input is a grid with 14 rows and 13 columns. Let's look for non-zero elements.\n\nRow0: [8,0,0,...] \u2192 first element is8, then zeros.\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,8,...] \u2192 first and fourth elements are8.\n\nRow4: [5,8,0,5,...] \u2192 5 at position0,8 at1,5 at3.\n\nRow5: [5,0,0,5,...] \u21925 at0 and3.\n\nRow7: [5,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0] \u21925 at0 and3,8 at6 and9.\n\nRow8: [5,0,8,5,8,0,...] \u21925 at0 and3,8 at2 and4.\n\nRow10: [5,8,0,5,...0,8,0,8] \u21925 at0 and3,8 at1,10,12.\n\nRow12: [8,0,0,8,...] \u21928 at0 and3.\n\nRow13: [0,...,0,8] \u21928 at12.\n\nThe non-zero elements are 8s and5s. The 5s appear in rows4-12 (rows4 to12), and 8s are scattered.\n\nAssuming the output is formed by taking each row's first and last non-zero elements and creating a symmetrical row with zeros in between. For example, if a row starts with 5 and ends with5, the output row is [5,0,...,0,5]. If there's a non-zero in the middle, it might appear in the center of the output row.\n\nLet's take the test input's row4: [5,8,0,5,0,0,...0,8]. The non-zeros here are5 at0,8 at1,5 at3, and8 at12. So first non-zero is5, last is8. So output row would be [5,0,...,0,8]. But in the training examples, the output rows start and end with the same number. So this approach might not work unless there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are determined by the first and last occurrence of a particular number in each row. For example, if a row starts with5 and ends with5, it's part of the5 layer. But the test input's rows vary.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a pattern in the training examples that can be applied.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nThe output rows are symmetrical and have the same first and last elements. The middle element is sometimes the middle non-zero of the input row.\n\nPerhaps the process is:\n\n1. For each row in the input, collect the non-zero elements.\n\n2. Create a symmetrical output row where the first and last elements are the first and last non-zero elements of the input row. The middle elements are the non-zero elements in between, arranged symmetrically.\n\nBut how to handle varying lengths.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input row1: non-zeros are [8,8,8]. The output row is [8,0,0,0,8]. So the output row is the first and last elements (8 and8), with zeros in between. But there are three non-zeros. So why isn't the middle element 8? Because maybe when there's an odd number of non-zeros, the middle is taken once, but when even, the middle is taken as zero. But in Example0's row3, input non-zeros are [5,8,5,8]. Output is [5,0,8,0,5]. So the first and last are5 and5, and the middle element is8. Which is the second non-zero in the input. So maybe when there's an even number of non-zeros, the middle element is the one at position (length-1)/2, but rounded. For four non-zeros, positions 0,1,2,3. Middle would be between 1 and2. So perhaps take element1, which is8, and place it in the middle of the output.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each input row:\n\n- Collect non-zero elements in order: [n1, n2, ..., nk].\n\n- The output row is [n1, 0, ..., 0, nk] if k is even.\n\n- If k is odd, the output row is [n1, 0, ..., middle element, ..., 0, nk].\n\nBut how to determine the output length. For example, in Example0's row1, k=3. The output length is5. So 2*(k-1) +1. For k=3, 5. For k=4, 2*(k-1) +1=7, but Example0's row3 has k=4 and output length5. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, the output row length is determined by the maximum possible distance between the first and last non-zero elements in any row of the input. For Example0, the first non-zero in row1 is at position1 and last at8. Distance is7, so output length is7+1=8, but Example0's output rows are length5. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output row length is the number of non-zero elements in the input row plus something. For Example0's row1, 3 non-zeros, output length5. 3+2=5. For row3, 4 non-zeros, output length5. 4+1=5. Not a clear pattern.\n\nMaybe the output row length is always the same for all rows in the output. For Example0, it's5. For Example1, it's7. For Example2, it's5. So the output row length depends on the input's row length. For example:\n\nExample0's input rows are length9 \u2192 output rows length5 (9-4=5).\n\nExample1's input rows are length11 \u2192 output rows length7 (11-4=7).\n\nExample2's input rows are length13 \u2192 output rows length5 (13-8=5). Wait, no. This doesn't hold. So maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, the output row length is the ceiling of input row length divided by2. For example:\n\n9 \u21925 (9/2=4.5 \u21925).\n\n11\u21926 (5.5 \u21926). But Example1's output rows are7. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to hypothesize a pattern and apply it to the test input.\n\nHypothesis: For each input row, the output row is formed by taking the first non-zero element, then the middle non-zero elements (if any), then the last non-zero element, arranged symmetrically. The length of the output row is determined by the number of non-zero elements plus padding zeros to create a symmetrical pattern.\n\nFor example:\n\nExample0's row1: [8,8,8] \u2192 output [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nExample0's row3: [5,8,5,8] \u2192 output [5,0,8,0,5].\n\nExample1's row4: [8,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0] \u2192 non-zeros 8,5,5. Output [8,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Wait, no. The output for Example1's row4 is [5,0,0,0,0,0,5].\n\nWait, this hypothesis doesn't fit. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me look at the test input. The test input has multiple rows with 5 and8. Let's try to apply the pattern from the examples.\n\nIn the training examples, each output row starts and ends with the same number (8 or5) and has zeros in between. The middle element is sometimes another 8 or5.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow0: [8,0,...0]. Only first element is8. Output row would be [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8] but since the last non-zero is also8 at position0. Wait, but in this case, the first and last non-zero are the same. So output row would be [8,0,...0,8], but the row has 13 elements. The output row length would be (13+1)/2=7. So maybe row0's output is [8,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nBut how to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, for each input row, the output row is formed by taking the first and last non-zero elements, with zeros in between, and the length is (number of columns in input row +1)/2.\n\nFor example, input row has 13 columns. Output row length (13+1)/2=7.\n\nSo for the test input's row0: first non-zero is8 at0, last non-zero is8 at0 (since the rest are zeros). So output row would be [8,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nBut that's just the first and last element of the input row, which is the same. But in the training examples, this would mean that rows with only one non-zero would have output rows with that number at both ends and zeros in between.\n\nBut let's check training example2's input. For instance, the first input row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0]. The non-zero elements are8 and8 at positions9 and10. So the output row for this would be [8,0,0,0,8]. Which matches Example2's output first row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each input row, the output row is formed by taking the first non-zero element, then filling zeros up to the middle, then the last non-zero element. If there are multiple non-zero elements in between, they are ignored, and the output row is simply the first and last non-zero, with zeros in between.\n\nBut how to determine the output row length. For example, in Example0's input rows of length9, the output rows are length5. Which is (9+1)/2=5. For Example1's input rows of length11, output rows are (11+1)/2=6, but the output rows are length7. Hmm, discrepancy.\n\nWait, Example1's output rows are length7. (11+1)/2=6. So that doesn't fit. But in Example1's output, the rows are length7.\n\nAnother possibility: the output row length is determined by the maximum number of non-zero elements in any row of the input plus one. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output row length is the distance between the first and last non-zero elements in the row plus one. For example, in Example0's row1, first non-zero at1, last at8. Distance is7, so length8. But output row length is5. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output row is formed by taking the first and last non-zero elements of each input row, creating a palindrome with zeros in between, and the length is determined by (input row length +1)/2.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input has 14 rows, each with 13 elements. So output row length is (13+1)/2=7.\n\nFor each row in the test input, find the first and last non-zero elements and create a row of length7 with those elements at the ends and zeros in between.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes there's a non-zero in the middle. For example, Example0's row3 input has non-zeros 5,8,5,8. Output is [5,0,8,0,5]. So the middle element is8. So perhaps when there are an even number of non-zeros, the middle element is the one at the first half of the non-zeros. For example, in four non-zeros, the second element is taken as the middle.\n\nSo the rule would be:\n\nFor each input row:\n\n1. Collect all non-zero elements in order.\n\n2. If there are an even number of non-zeros, take the first, then the element at position len(nonZeros)//2, then the last.\n\n3. If odd, take the first, middle, and last.\n\n4. Create a palindrome with these elements, padding with zeros to reach the required length.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each input row, the output row is formed as follows:\n\n- The first element is the first non-zero.\n\n- The last element is the last non-zero.\n\n- The middle element (if any) is the median non-zero.\n\n- Other positions are zeros.\n\nFor example, in Example0's row3 input non-zeros are [5,8,5,8]. The middle elements are 8 and5. Taking the first of them (8) as the middle. So output row becomes [5,0,8,0,5].\n\nIn Example0's row1 input non-zeros are [8,8,8], so middle is8. Output row is [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nIn Example1's row4 input non-zeros are [8,5,5], so middle is5. Output row is [8,0,0,0,0,0,8], but in Example1's output row for row4 is [5,0,0,0,0,0,5]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This approach doesn't hold.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to look for the minimal pattern that transforms the input to output in the examples. For example, in all examples, the output rows are palindromes starting and ending with the same number (8 or5), and the middle elements are zeros except when there's a non-zero in the middle of the input's non-zero sequence.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach for the test input:\n\nFor each row in the test input:\n\n- Find the first and last non-zero elements.\n\n- Create a row of length ceil(input row length / 2), but according to the training examples, for input row length9, output5; length11, output7; length13, output5. But this isn't consistent. So perhaps the output row length is determined by the input's row length minus 4 (9-4=5, 11-4=7, 13-4=9 \u2192 but Example2's output is5, so 13-8=5. Not consistent.)\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are of odd lengths, and the length is determined by the number of non-zero elements in the row. For example, if a row has 3 non-zeros, output length5; if5 non-zeros, output length7. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that time is limited, I'll proceed with the assumption that for each row in the test input, the output row is formed by taking the first and last non-zero elements and creating a palindrome with zeros in between. The length is determined by the training examples' patterns. For example, in the test input's rows have length13, so the output row length would be (13+1)/2=7.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [8,0,0,...0]. First non-zero is8 at0, last is8 at0. So output row is [8,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow1: all zeros. So output is all zeros? But training examples don't have rows with all zeros in the output. So perhaps skipped.\n\nRow2: first non-zero is8 at8. Last non-zero is8 at8. So output row is [8,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow3: first non-zero is8 at0 and3. So first is8 at0, last is8 at3. Output row is [8,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow4: non-zeros are5 at0,8 at1,5 at3,8 at12. First non-zero is5 at0, last is8 at12. So output row is [5,0,0,0,0,0,8]. But this isn't a palindrome. So this contradicts the training examples where outputs are palindromes. Thus, this approach is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: The output rows are formed by taking the first non-zero and the last non-zero if they are the same. If different, ignore the row or take the first one.\n\nBut this would lead to many rows being skipped. The training examples don't skip rows. For example, Example0's input row0 is all zeros, but the output row0 is [8,0,0,0,8], which corresponds to input row1. So perhaps the output only includes rows that have non-zero elements.\n\nBut the output in Example0 has 5 rows, which matches the input rows that have non-zeros. For Example0's input, rows1,2,3,4,5,7,8 have non-zeros, but the output has5 rows. So perhaps there's a selection of rows based on some criteria.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given time constraints, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input, the rows with non-zeros are rows0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13.\n\nThe output will likely be formed by these rows, but with some transformation.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow4: [5,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Non-zeros:5 at0,8 at1,5 at3,8 at12.\n\nFirst non-zero is5, last is8. This would not form a valid output row as per training examples (since they start and end with the same number). So this row might be excluded from the output.\n\nSimilarly, row5: [5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. First and last non-zero are5 and5. So output row would be [5,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow7: [5,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0]. Non-zeros:5,5,8,8. First is5, last is8. So output row would start and end with different numbers, which isn't seen in training examples. So this row might be excluded.\n\nRow10: [5,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8]. Non-zeros:5,8,5,8,8. First is5, last is8. Again, mismatch.\n\nThus, only the rows where the first and last non-zero are the same will be included.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nRow0: first and last non-zero are8 and8 \u2192 included.\n\nRow3: first8, last8 \u2192 included.\n\nRow4: first5, last8 \u2192 excluded.\n\nRow5: first5, last5 \u2192 included.\n\nRow7: first5, last8 \u2192 excluded.\n\nRow8: first5, last8 \u2192 excluded.\n\nRow10: first5, last8 \u2192 excluded.\n\nRow12: first8, last8 \u2192 included.\n\nRow13: first8, last8 \u2192 included.\n\nSo the rows that meet the condition are rows0,3,5,12,13.\n\nBut the training examples have outputs with multiple rows. For example, Example0's output has5 rows. So perhaps the test output will have rows0,3,5,12,13, but this is uncertain.\n\nFor each selected row, create a palindrome row with first and last non-zero elements.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow0: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow5: [5,0,0,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow12: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow13: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nBut this may not be correct. Alternatively, the output rows are created by taking the first and last non-zero elements and creating a symmetrical row of length 7 (since input row length is13, (13+1)/2=7).\n\nBut the example outputs have varying row lengths. For Example2's input rows of length13, the output rows are length5. So perhaps the test output's rows are length5.\n\nIn that case, for row0 of the test input, first non-zero is8 at0, last non-zero is8 at0 (since others are zeros). So output row is [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow3: first8 at0, last8 at3. Output row would be [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow5: first5 at0, last5 at3. Output row [5,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow12: first8 at0, last8 at3. Output [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow13: first8 at12. Output [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs have varying numbers. For example, Example2's output has6 rows. So maybe there are more rows included.\n\nAlternatively, considering that some rows in the test input have multiple non-zeros that could form middle elements.\n\nFor example, row5: [5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Non-zeros are5 at0 and3. So output row [5,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow7: [5,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0]. Non-zeros are5,5,8,8. First5, last8. So excluded.\n\nRow8: [5,0,8,5,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Non-zeros are5,8,5,8,8. First5, last8. Excluded.\n\nRow10: [5,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8]. Non-zeros are5,8,5,8,8. First5, last8. Excluded.\n\nRow4: [5,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Non-zeros are5,8,5,8. First5, last8. Excluded.\n\nRow12: [8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Non-zeros are8,8. Output [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow13: [0,...,8]. Non-zero at12. Output [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nSo the possible output rows are:\n\nFrom row0: [8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow5: [5,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow12: [8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow13: [8,0,0,0,8]\n\nBut this would give 5 rows. But in the training examples, Example0's output has5 rows, Example1's5, Example2's6. So maybe the test output will have5 rows.\n\nBut the test input has more rows that meet the criteria. For example, row0,3,5,12,13. That's five rows. So the output might be:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\nBut this seems too repetitive. Looking at the training examples, the outputs have varying middle elements. For example, Example0's output has a row with a middle8.\n\nIn the test input's row5: [5,0,0,5,0,...]. The non-zeros are at0 and3. So the output row is [5,0,0,0,5]. But what about row5's input has non-zeros at0 and3. If the output row is formed by first and last non-zero (both5), and the middle elements are zeros. So [5,0,0,0,5], which is correct.\n\nRow3's input: [8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Non-zeros at0 and3. Output row [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow0's input: [8,0,...0]. Non-zero at0. Output [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow12's input: [8,0,0,8,0...]. Non-zeros at0 and3. Output [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow13's input: [0,...,8]. Non-zero at12. Output [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nBut why are these rows included and others not? Because their first and last non-zero are the same.\n\nThus, the test output would be:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\nBut this seems repetitive. However, looking at the training examples, the outputs have layers of 8s and5s. For example, Example0's output has 8s on the top and bottom, and5s in between. Perhaps the test output is similar, with multiple 8 layers and a single5 layer.\n\nThus, the final answer would be:\n\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\n[5, 0, 8, 0, 5]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\n[5, 0, 8, 0, 5]\n\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nBut how does this fit with the test input? I'm not sure. Maybe the test input has a more complex structure with middle elements.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output rows are formed by taking the first and last non-zero elements of each input row, creating a symmetrical row with zeros in between. The output rows are those where the first and last non-zero are the same. For the test input, this results in the rows mentioned above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples and then apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input is a 9x9 matrix. The output is a 5x5 matrix. The numbers in the output seem to be 8s and 5s arranged in a cross-like pattern. Let me see:\n\nOriginal input rows for Example 0:\n\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8]\nRow 3: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0]\nRow 5: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 6: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\nRow 9: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput is a 5x5 matrix. Let's see the output rows:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\nHmm, the output seems to capture the non-zero elements in the input, but arranged in a certain way. Let's check where the 8s and 5s are in the input. For instance, the first output row is [8,0,0,0,8]. Looking at the input's row 2, there are 8s at positions 2, 6, and 9 (if we index starting at 1). Wait, maybe it's about the middle elements? Let's see the dimensions. The input is 9x9, so the center would be at position (5,5). The output is 5x5. Maybe each output row corresponds to a central row in the input, but taking elements at certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle row and middle column of the input. For example, in a 9x9 matrix, the middle row is row 5, and the middle column is column 5. But how does that form the output matrix?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output. The first row of the output is [8,0,0,0,8]. Let's check the input's row 2. The 8s in row 2 are at columns 2,6,9. But in the output's first row, the first and last elements are 8. Maybe it's capturing the first and last non-zero elements of each row, but that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's taking the outermost non-zero elements from each layer of the matrix. For example, if the input matrix is a square, the output is formed by the outer edges, but condensed. Or perhaps it's taking the non-zero elements from the perimeter of each concentric square in the input and arranging them in the output.\n\nWait, let's think about the dimensions. The input matrices in the examples vary in size. Example 0 is 9x9, output 5x5. Example 1's input is 9 rows of 11 elements each (11 columns?), output is 5 rows of 7 elements. Example 2's input is 11 rows of 13 columns, output is 6 rows of 5 elements. Wait, perhaps the output's number of rows and columns depends on the input's size. For example, in Example 0: input is 9x9 (odd), output 5x5 (which is (9+1)/2 - 1? Not sure. Example 1's input is 9 rows, 11 columns. Output is 5 rows, 7 columns. Hmm, 11-4=7, 9-4=5. Similarly, 13-8=5 (Example 2's input is 13 columns, output 5 columns). So maybe the output's rows and columns are the input rows minus some even number. Alternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking every other row and column, but that may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by considering the positions of the non-zero elements in the input matrix, and then creating a smaller matrix where each row and column is determined by the presence of certain numbers (like 8 and 5) in specific positions.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the non-zero elements (8 and 5) form a diamond or cross pattern. For example, the 8s are in rows 2,4,6,8,9, and columns 2,6,8, etc. The output is a diamond shape with 8s at the corners and 5s in the middle rows. The middle row of the output has an 8 in the center. Wait, the output's middle row (third row) is [5,0,8,0,5]. That 8 in the center could correspond to the center of the input matrix (position 5,5). Let's check input's row 4, column 4: in example 0's input, row 4 is [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0]. So the 8 is in column 4. The center of 9x9 is (5,5), which in row 5, column 5. Wait, but row 4's 8 is at column 4. Hmm, maybe not directly the center.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is capturing the non-zero elements along the diagonals or other lines. Wait, the output for example 0 has 8s in the first and last positions of the first and last rows. Then 5s in the first and last positions of the middle rows. And the center has an 8. So maybe the output is a cross where the 8s and 5s are arranged in a pattern that's a cross, perhaps capturing the positions from the input.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for each output row in the input. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row is [8,0,0,0,8]. Looking at the input, row 2 has 8s at positions 2,6,9. But the output's first row has 8s at positions 1 and 5. Hmm. Maybe it's taking the first, middle, and last elements? For a 9-element row, the middle is position 5. So, maybe the output row is taking the first non-zero, middle non-zero, and last non-zero? But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by extracting certain columns and rows from the input. For example, in Example 0, the input has 9 rows and 9 columns, output 5 rows and 5 columns. Maybe taking columns 2,4,6,8, etc. Wait, but the output's first row is [8,0,0,0,8]. Let's check input row 2: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. If we take every other column starting from column 2: columns 2,4,6,8, etc. But columns 2,4,6,8 in row 2 would be 8,0,8,0. But that's only 4 elements. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by collapsing the input's rows and columns. For example, taking the maximum value in each quadrant. Or perhaps the output is the sum or some aggregation of certain cells. But since the outputs have zeros, maybe it's preserving certain positions.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input is 9 rows with 11 columns each. The output is 5 rows with 7 columns. The output's first row is [8,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Let's check the input's first row: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The non-zero is 8 at column 2. The output's first row has 8 at first and last position. How does that correspond? Maybe taking the first and last non-zero elements from each row and placing them at the ends of the output row, and the middle elements are filled with zeros. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in each row of the input and creating a row where the first and last elements are those values, and the middle elements are zeros. But let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 2: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. The non-zero elements are at positions 2,6,9. The leftmost is 8 at position 2, rightmost at 9. The output row is [8,0,0,0,8]. So the first element is 8, last is 8, and zeros in between. That fits. Similarly, row 3 in input is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Leftmost non-zero is 5 at position 2, rightmost at position 6. Output row 2 is [5,0,0,0,5]. So yes, that seems to fit. Then, for row 4 in input: [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0]. Leftmost non-zero is 5 at position 2, rightmost is 8 at position 8. Output row 3 is [5,0,8,0,5]. Wait, but the output here has 5,0,8,0,5. So the first and last are 5, but the middle element is 8. That doesn't fit the leftmost and rightmost. Hmm. So that theory might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output captures the first and last non-zero elements in each row, and the middle element captures the central non-zero element. But how?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input row 4: [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0]. The non-zero elements are at positions 2,4,6,8. The leftmost is 5 (pos 2), rightmost is 8 (pos 8). The output row is [5,0,8,0,5]. The middle element is 8, which is at position 4 in the input row, which is the center of the 9-element row (position 5 is the center, but in this case, the 8 is at position 4. So maybe not the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is constructed by taking the first non-zero, then the middle non-zero (if any), then the last non-zero. But in row 4 of Example 0's input, the non-zero elements are 5,8,5,8. The first is 5, the last is 8. But the middle elements are 8 and 5. The output has 5,0,8,0,5. So first and last are 5, middle is 8. How does that come?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by considering the entire input matrix and for each row, taking the first and last non-zero elements and any non-zero elements in the central columns. But how to determine the central columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a result of collapsing the input into a diamond-shaped structure. For example, the output's rows correspond to certain layers in the input matrix, capturing the 8s and 5s along specific diagonals.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the numbers 8 and 5. In the outputs, they form a pattern where 8 is at the corners and certain middle positions, and 5 is in between. Maybe the numbers represent different layers or distances from the center. For example, 8 could be the outer layer, and 5 the inner layer. But how does that apply to the input?\n\nWait, perhaps the input is a grid where numbers 8 and 5 form concentric diamonds or squares. The output is then capturing each layer. For instance, each row in the output corresponds to a ring in the input. For example, the outermost ring (8s) forms the first and last row of the output, and the inner rings (5s) form the middle rows. Then, the center has another 8.\n\nBut how does that fit with the input and output?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nRow 1: 8s at ends\nRow 2: 5s at ends\nRow 3: 5s at ends and 8 in center\nRow 4: 5s at ends\nRow 5: 8s at ends\n\nSo maybe the output is layers of the input. The first and last layers (outermost) are 8s, then inner layers are 5s, and the center has an 8. But how to extract this from the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row in the output corresponds to a diagonal in the input matrix, capturing the non-zero elements. For example, the output's first row could be the main diagonal of the input, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, let's consider the test input. The test input has 14 rows and 13 columns. The output's number of rows and columns would depend on the pattern. The training examples show that input rows and columns decrease in the output. For example, Example 0's 9x9 \u2192 5x5, which is (9+1)/2 =5. Example1's input is 9x11, output 5x7. 9 \u21925 (9-4=5), 11\u21927 (11-4=7). Example2's input is 11x13, output 6x5. Hmm, that doesn't fit the same pattern. Alternatively, maybe the output rows and columns are determined by the number of non-zero layers in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking every other row and column from the input, but centered. For example, in a 9x9 input, taking rows 2,4,6,8, etc. But the output has 5 rows. Let's see for Example 0:\n\nInput rows 9. Output rows 5. Taking every other row starting from row 2: 2,4,6,8,9? Not sure. But the output rows in Example0 are 5 rows, which could correspond to the middle rows of the input. For example, rows 2,3,4,5,6. But output rows are 5. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are the middle rows of the input. For example, in a 9-row input, the middle row is row 5. But the output has 5 rows. Maybe rows 3-7, which is 5 rows. Let's check. In Example0's output, the middle row (third) of the output is [5,0,8,0,5]. Looking at the input's row4: [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0]. If we take columns 3-7 (positions 3 to 7 inclusive), which are 0,8,0,5,0. That doesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if the output rows correspond to the non-zero rows of the input. In Example0, the input has rows with non-zero elements in rows 2,3,4,5,6,8,9. But the output is 5 rows. Hmm, that doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe each output row is formed by the first and last non-zero elements of the corresponding input row. For example, in Example0's input row2: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. First non-zero is 8 (position2), last is 8 (position9). Output row1 is [8,0,0,0,8]. So positions 1 and 5 are 8. If the output has 5 elements, then the first and last elements are the first and last non-zero of the input row. The middle elements are filled with zeros. But what about when there are more non-zero elements?\n\nLooking at input row4 in Example0: [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0]. First non-zero is 5 (position2), last is 8 (position8). Output row3 is [5,0,8,0,5]. Wait, here the output has 5 elements. First is 5, last is 5. But in the input, the last non-zero is 8. That contradicts. So this theory isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements of each row and placing them at the ends, and then including any non-zero elements that are in the center of the row. For example, in row4 of input Example0: left is 5, right is 8. But the output row is [5,0,8,0,5]. So middle is 8, and ends are 5. How does that happen?\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by considering the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements and any non-zero elements in the middle columns. For instance, in Example0, the input row4 has 5 at position2, 8 at position4, 5 at position6, and 8 at position8. The output row is [5,0,8,0,5]. So maybe the output takes the leftmost (5), the center (position5 is 0, but there's an 8 at position4), so perhaps the middle element is the first non-zero in the center area. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is a compressed version of the input where consecutive zeros are collapsed into single zeros. But the output examples don't show that. For example, the input row in Example0's row2 has [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. If compressed, it would be 8,0,8,0,8. But the output row is [8,0,0,0,8], which is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the central cross section of the input. For example, taking the middle row and middle column. But how that forms the output matrix.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output:\n\nRow1: 8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 maybe these are the first and last non-zero elements of row2 (input) and row8 (input). Or perhaps the output is a diamond where each layer is a ring of 8s and 5s.\n\nAlternatively, considering the input as a grid where 8s form a diamond and 5s form another diamond inside. The output is then the diamond layers. For example, the outermost layer (8s) becomes the first and last rows of the output, then the next layer (5s), then the center layer (8 again). This could explain the pattern in Example0's output.\n\nBut how to map the input to this diamond structure. Let's check the positions of the 8s and 5s in Example0's input. The 8s are at positions (2,2), (2,6), (2,9), (4,4), (4,8), (6,6), (8,4), (8,8), (9,2). The 5s are at (3,2), (3,6), (4,2), (4,6), (5,2), (5,6), (4,8?), etc. Hmm, this is a bit messy. But the output has 8s at the corners and 5s in between. Maybe the pattern is that the output is formed by the non-zero elements arranged in concentric diamonds, each row of the output corresponding to a layer. The first layer (outermost) is 8s, then 5s, then 8s again in the center.\n\nIf that's the case, then for the test input, we need to identify the layers of 8s and 5s and arrange them in the output accordingly.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe input is a matrix with 14 rows and 13 columns. Let's look for 8s and 5s.\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow3: [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow4: [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nRow5: [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow6: [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow7: [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow8: [5, 0, 8, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nRow9: [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow10: [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8]\n\nRow11: [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow12: [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow13: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nLooking for non-zero elements:\n\nRow0 has an 8 at position0.\n\nRow2 has an 8 at position8.\n\nRow3 has 8s at positions0 and3.\n\nRow4 has 5 at0, 8 at1, 5 at3, 8 at12.\n\nRow5 has 5s at0 and3.\n\nRow6 has 5s at0 and3.\n\nRow7 has 5s at0 and3, 8s at6 and9.\n\nRow8 has 5s at0 and3, 8 at2 and4 and12.\n\nRow9 has 5s at0 and3, 8 at5.\n\nRow10 has 5s at0 and3, 8 at1, 8 at10 and12.\n\nRow11 has 5s at0 and3, 8 at7.\n\nRow12 has 8s at0 and3.\n\nRow13 has 8 at12.\n\nSo the 8s and 5s are arranged in certain positions. The 5s are mostly in columns0 and3. The 8s are scattered in various positions.\n\nNow, considering the pattern from the training examples, which seems to extract layers of 8s and 5s. For example, in Example0, the output starts and ends with 8s, with 5s in between. In Example2, the output has multiple layers of 5s and 8s.\n\nLooking at the test input, the 5s are present in columns0 and3 across multiple rows. The 8s are in various positions. Perhaps the output will have rows where the first and last elements are 8s or 5s based on the outermost layers, and inner elements based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test input's structure, perhaps the output rows will have 5s at the ends (since many rows have 5s at column0 and3, but wait, maybe the output rows are built by taking the first and last non-zero elements of each row in the input. For example, row4 in the test input: [5,8,0,5,...8]. The first non-zero is 5, last is 8. So the output row would be [5,0,0,0,8]. But looking at the training examples, the output rows often have the same number at both ends, like [8,0,0,0,8] or [5,0,0,0,5]. So maybe the first and last non-zero of each row must be the same number, and that's what's captured.\n\nLooking at Example0's input row2: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. The non-zero elements are 8s, so the output row is [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow3 of input: [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Non-zero elements are 5s, so output row is [5,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow4 of input: [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0]. Non-zero elements are 5,8,5,8. So first is 5, last is 8. But the output row is [5,0,8,0,5]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. The output row starts and ends with 5. But the last non-zero in the input row4 is 8 (position8). So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: The output rows in the examples have the same number at both ends. So perhaps the input rows must have the same first and last non-zero elements, and the output captures that. If the first and last non-zero elements are the same, they form the ends of the output row. If different, perhaps they are not included. But in Example0's row4, the first non-zero is 5 and last is 8, but the output row starts and ends with 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the leftmost and rightmost occurrence of a certain number (either 8 or 5) per row, but focusing on the dominant number in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by looking for the numbers in specific positions relative to the center of the input matrix.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think about the output dimensions. For example:\n\nExample0: input 9x9 \u2192 output 5x5. 5 is (9-4)/1? Not sure.\n\nExample1: input 9x11 \u2192 output 5x7. So rows decrease by 4, columns decrease by4.\n\nExample2: input 11x13 \u2192 output 6x5. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's number of rows corresponds to the number of distinct layers of non-zero elements in the input, and the columns are determined similarly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the central part of the input matrix. For example, for a 9x9 matrix, taking the center 5x5 part. Let's check Example0's input. The center 5x5 part would be rows 3-7 and columns 3-7. Let's see:\n\nRow3: [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0] \u2192 columns3-7: 8,0,5,0,8. So the output row3 is [5,0,8,0,5]. Not matching. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output may be transposed or rotated. But I don't see an obvious pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the output rows, they seem to form a symmetric pattern. For example, in Example0's output, each row is symmetric. The first and last elements are the same. So the transformation likely involves capturing symmetric elements from the input.\n\nLooking at Example0's input row4: [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0]. The output row3 is [5,0,8,0,5]. The first and last are 5, and the middle is 8. The input row4 has 5s at positions2 and6, and 8s at positions4 and8. So perhaps the output row is constructed by taking the leftmost 5 (position2), then the leftmost 8 (position4), then the rightmost 5 (position6), but arranged symmetrically. Or perhaps it's taking the leftmost and rightmost 5s and the leftmost 8 in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to the non-zero elements of a certain 'ring' or layer in the input, arranged in a specific order. For example, the outer ring has 8s, the next ring has 5s, etc.\n\nBut how to determine the layers. For instance, in Example0's input, the 8s form a kind of diamond shape. Maybe the output captures each diamond layer as a row. The outermost layer (8s) becomes the first and last rows of the output. Then inner layers (5s) become the next rows, and the center (8) becomes the middle row.\n\nBut how to map that. For instance, the output's first row is [8,0,0,0,8]. Maybe this corresponds to the outermost 8s in the input. Then the next rows are inner layers.\n\nBut in the input of Example0, the 8s are spread out in various positions, not forming a clear diamond. So this may not hold.\n\nAt this point, perhaps it's best to look for a pattern that involves the first and last non-zero elements of each row, and then the middle non-zero element if present. For example:\n\nEach output row has the same number of elements as the number of layers in the input. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the output is a diamond-shaped matrix formed by the non-zero elements of the input. For example, the output's rows have increasing then decreasing lengths. But the training examples' outputs are all rectangular matrices. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: The output matrices in the examples have a pattern where the first and last elements of each row are the same, and the middle elements are either zeros or a single non-zero. For example, the first output row in Example0 is [8,0,0,0,8], second is [5,0,0,0,5], third is [5,0,8,0,5], etc. So maybe each row in the output is formed by taking the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements of the corresponding row in the input, and if there's a non-zero in the middle column, it's placed in the center of the output row.\n\nSo, for example, in a row with leftmost and rightmost as 8, and a middle non-zero as 8, the output row would be [8,0,8,0,8], but in Example0's row4 input, the output row is [5,0,8,0,5]. The leftmost and rightmost are 5, and the middle is 8. So this suggests that the leftmost and rightmost are taken as 5, and any non-zero in the middle columns are placed in the center.\n\nBut how to determine which middle columns to consider. For instance, in Example0's row4 input, the middle of the row (position5) is zero, but there's an 8 at position4. So perhaps the output's middle element is the first non-zero encountered when moving from left to right in the central region of the input row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the leftmost non-zero, the first non-zero in the middle third of the row, and the rightmost non-zero. For example, in a 9-element row, the middle third would be positions 4-6. So in Example0's row4 input, the middle third has 8 (position4) and 5 (position6). So the output row would take the leftmost 5, the middle 8, and the rightmost 5, resulting in [5,0,8,0,5].\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's row2 input: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. Leftmost is 8, rightmost is8. Middle third (positions4-6) is 0,0,8. The first non-zero in the middle third is 8 at position6. So the output row would be [8,0,8,0,8]. But the actual output row is [8,0,0,0,8]. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the middle element in the output row corresponds to the center of the input row. For a 9-element row, the center is position5. In Example0's row4 input, position5 is 0. But the output row has an 8 in the middle. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row's middle element is the first non-zero element found when looking from the center outward. For example, in row4 of Example0's input, the center is position5 (0), then check position4 (8), which is non-zero. So middle element is 8. That would explain the output row [5,0,8,0,5]. So leftmost is 5, rightmost is5, middle is8.\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's test this theory:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n1. Find the leftmost non-zero element (L).\n2. Find the rightmost non-zero element (R).\n3. Find the first non-zero element when moving from the center left and right (M).\n\nThe output row is then [L, 0, M, 0, R]. But wait, in Example0's row4 output, it's [5,0,8,0,5]. So L and R are 5, and M is8.\n\nBut how is M determined? The input row4 is [0,5,0,8,0,5,0,8,0]. The center is position5 (index4 in 0-based). Position5 is 0. Then check positions4 and6 (since they are next to the center). Position4 is 8 (non-zero), so M=8. Hence, the output row becomes [5,0,8,0,5], which matches.\n\nFor row2 of Example0's input: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. Leftmost is8 (position1), rightmost is8 (position8). Center is position4 (0). Check positions4 and5 (0 and0). Then check positions3 and6. Position3 is0, position6 is8. So M=8. So the output row should be [8,0,8,0,8]. But the actual output row is [8,0,0,0,8]. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm, conflicting results. So maybe this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe M is the first non-zero element encountered when moving from the center outward, but only in even-length rows. Or perhaps the output's middle element is only present if there's a non-zero in the exact center. But in Example0's row4 input, the center is zero, but the output has an 8 in the middle.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of the non-zero elements in the input and see how they correspond to the output's elements.\n\nExample0's input has 9 rows and 9 columns. The output is 5x5. Let's see the coordinates (row, column) of non-zero elements:\n\nRow 2 (index1 in 0-based):\n\nColumns with 8: 1,5,8.\n\nRow3 (index2):\n\nColumns with5:1,5.\n\nRow4 (index3):\n\nColumns with5:1,5,7.\n\nRow5 (index4):\n\nColumns with5:1,5.\n\nRow6 (index5):\n\nColumns with8:1,5.\n\nRow8 (index7):\n\nColumns with8:3,7.\n\nRow9 (index8):\n\nColumns with8:1.\n\nSo the output is 5 rows. Let's see what each output row corresponds to:\n\nOutput row0: [8,0,0,0,8]. This could correspond to input row2 (8s at columns1 and5 and8), but in the output, it's [8,0,0,0,8]. So the 8s are at positions0 and4 of the output row. For a 5-element output row, positions0 and4. Maybe these are the first and last non-zero of the input row, and the middle is zeros. But in input row2, the first non-zero is at column1 (8), last at column8 (8). So output row0 has 8s at the first and last positions. But how does column1 and8 in input row2 translate to positions0 and4 in the output row.\n\nPerhaps the columns in the input are compressed into the output by some formula. For example, in a 9-column input row, the output has 5 columns. Maybe each output column corresponds to every other column, starting from the first. For example, columns0,2,4,6,8 of the input become columns0-4 in the output. Let's check:\n\nInput row2's columns0,2,4,6,8 are:0,0,0,0,8. So output row would be [0,0,0,0,8], which doesn't match the actual output [8,0,0,0,8]. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, columns1,3,5,7,9 (assuming 1-based). But input row2's columns1,3,5,7,9 (1-based) are 8,0,8,0,8. But the output row is [8,0,0,0,8]. So again, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, columns2,4,6,8 in 0-based (if input columns are 0-8). Input row2's columns2,4,6,8:0,0,0,8. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output columns are the central 5 columns of the input. For a 9-column input, columns2-6 (indices 2-6). Input row2's columns2-6 are 0,0,0,8,0. Output row0 is [8,0,0,0,8], which doesn't match.\n\nThis line of thought isn't yielding progress. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nIn all the training examples, the output matrices have the following structure:\n\n- The first and last rows are composed of 8s at the ends and zeros in between.\n- The middle rows (except the center) have 5s at the ends and zeros in between.\n- The center row has 5s at the ends and an 8 in the middle.\n\nThis suggests that the output is a diamond shape where the outermost layer is 8s, followed by 5s, and the center is an 8. Now, how does this relate to the input?\n\nPerhaps the input matrix contains multiple diamond layers of 8s and 5s, and the output is each of these layers condensed into rows. For example, each row in the output represents a horizontal slice through these diamond layers.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the vertical slice of the input matrix. For instance, taking the central column and certain rows. But how.\n\nAnother idea: In Example0's output, the number of rows (5) corresponds to the number of distinct layers in the input. For example, the outermost layer (8s), then a layer of 5s, then a layer of 8s. Each layer is captured as a row in the output.\n\nBut how to identify these layers. Looking at the input of Example0:\n\nThe 8s are at positions (1,1), (1,5), (1,8), (3,3), (3,7), (5,5), (7,3), (7,7), (8,1).\n\nThe 5s are at (2,1), (2,5), (3,1), (3,5), (3,7), (4,1), (4,5), (5,1), (5,5).\n\nThis seems to form two concentric diamonds: an outer diamond of 8s and an inner diamond of 5s, with an 8 at the center. The output's rows could be capturing each horizontal slice through these diamonds.\n\nFor example, the first output row (8s) corresponds to the top and bottom layers of the outer diamond. The second and fourth rows (5s) correspond to the inner diamond's layers. The third row (5,8,5) corresponds to the center layer with the 8 in the middle.\n\nIf this is the case, then the output is formed by taking each horizontal slice of the diamond layers in the input matrix, condensing them into rows where the non-zero elements are placed at the ends and center based on their layer.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe test input's 8s and 5s likely form similar diamond layers. We need to identify these layers and construct the output rows accordingly.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\nThe 5s are mostly in columns0 and3, which might form vertical lines. The 8s are scattered in various positions, possibly forming a different pattern.\n\nFor example, rows4-11 have 5s in columns0 and3. These could form the inner diamond (5s) in the output. The 8s are in positions that might form an outer diamond and a central 8.\n\nThe output would then have rows with 8s at the ends (outer diamond), 5s at the ends (inner diamond), and possibly a central 8.\n\nLooking at the test input's structure, perhaps the output will have:\n\n- Rows with 8s at the ends (from the outer 8s)\n- Rows with 5s at the ends (from the inner 5s)\n- A central row with 5s and an 8 in the middle.\n\nBut to construct this, we need to determine which rows in the input correspond to each layer.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is formed by the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements of each input row that form part of a diamond layer. For example, in the test input, rows with 8s at the far left and right would contribute to the outer layers, while rows with 5s at certain positions contribute to the inner layers.\n\nBut this is quite vague. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the pattern where each output row is formed by the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements of the corresponding input row, and any non-zero elements in the center columns are placed in the middle of the output row, with zeros elsewhere. If the leftmost and rightmost are the same, they form the ends. If there's a non-zero in the center, it's placed in the middle.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nLet's process each row of the test input to form the output.\n\nTest input has 14 rows. Let's look for rows with non-zero elements.\n\nRow0: [8,0,0,...] \u2192 leftmost 8, rightmost 0 (since all others are 0). So output row would be [8,0,0,0,0], but the output examples have the same number at both ends. So this row may not contribute.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. Leftmost non-zero is8 at column8. Rightmost is8 at column8. So output row would be [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,8,0,...]. Leftmost8 at column0, rightmost8 at column3. So output row would be [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow4: [5,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Leftmost5 at column0, rightmost8 at column12. Since left and right are different, perhaps this row isn't included. Or maybe only rows where left and right are the same are included.\n\nRow5: [5,0,0,5,0,...]. Leftmost5 at0, rightmost5 at3. Same number. So output row would be [5,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow6: [5,0,0,5,0,...]. Same as row5 \u2192 [5,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow7: [5,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0]. Leftmost5 at0, rightmost5 at3. So output row [5,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow8: [5,0,8,5,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Leftmost5 at0, rightmost8 at12. Different, so not included.\n\nRow9: [5,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Leftmost5 at0, rightmost5 at3. So [5,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow10: [5,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8]. Leftmost5 at0, rightmost8 at12. Different, so not included.\n\nRow11: [5,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Leftmost5 at0, rightmost5 at3. So [5,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow12: [8,0,0,8,0,...]. Leftmost8 at0, rightmost8 at3. So [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow13: [0,...,8]. Leftmost8 at12, but row13 has all zeros except the last element. So output row would be [8,0,0,0,8], but since it's the last row, maybe it's included.\n\nNow, compiling these rows:\n\nFrom row0: [8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 not sure.\n\nRow2: [8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow5: [5,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow6: [5,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow7: [5,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow9: [5,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow11: [5,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow12: [8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow13: [8,0,0,0,8]\n\nBut this gives us multiple similar rows. For example, multiple [5,0,0,0,5] rows. However, looking at the training examples, the outputs have varying numbers of 5 rows depending on the layers. For example, Example0's output has two 5 rows sandwiching a row with an 8 in the center.\n\nIn the test input, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the rows where left and right non-zero are the same, and then adding the central non-zero if present.\n\nFor example, in row4 of the test input: [5,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Leftmost is5, rightmost is8. Not same, so not included.\n\nRow7: [5,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0]. Left and right non-zero are5 and5 (at columns0 and3). So output row is [5,0,0,0,5]. But what about the 8s in columns6 and9. Since the output row has 5 elements, maybe the middle element is the first non-zero in the middle columns of the input row. For row7, the middle column of a 13-column row is column6 (0-based). The element at column6 is8. So output row would be [5,0,8,0,5].\n\nAh, this would match the pattern seen in the training examples where some rows have a non-zero in the middle.\n\nSo, the rule would be:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n1. If the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements are the same, create an output row with those elements at the ends.\n2. Check the middle column(s) of the input row. If there's a non-zero element in the middle column(s), place it in the center of the output row.\n3. Fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to determine the middle column(s) based on the row's length.\n\nFor a row with length N:\n\n- The middle column is floor(N/2).\n- If N is odd, there's one middle column.\n- If even, maybe two middle columns.\n\nIn Example0's input rows (length 9), middle column is4 (0-based).\n\nIn row4 of Example0's input, the middle column4 is0, but there's an8 at column3. So perhaps if the middle column is zero, look for the closest non-zero to the middle.\n\nAlternatively, the middle element of the output row is the first non-zero encountered when moving from the middle column outward.\n\nFor example, in row7 of the test input (length13), middle column is6 (0-based). The element at column6 is8. So output row would be [5,0,8,0,5].\n\nApplying this to all rows:\n\nRow0: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Leftmost is8, rightmost is0. Not same. Ignored.\n\nRow1: all zeros. Ignored.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. Leftmost is8 (col8), rightmost is8 (col8). Middle column is6 (col6: 0). So output row [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Leftmost8 (col0), rightmost8 (col3). Not same. So ignored.\n\nRow4: [5,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Leftmost5 (col0), rightmost8 (col12). Different. Ignored.\n\nRow5: [5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Leftmost5 (col0), rightmost5 (col3). Same. Middle column6 (0). So output row [5,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow6: [5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Same as row5 \u2192 [5,0,0,0,5].\n\nRow7: [5,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0]. Leftmost5 (col0), rightmost5 (col3). Same. Middle column6:8. So output row [5,0,8,0,5].\n\nRow8: [5,0,8,5,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Leftmost5 (col0), rightmost8 (col12). Different. Ignored.\n\nRow9: [5,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Leftmost5 (col0), rightmost5 (col3). Same. Middle column6:8. So output row [5,0,8,0,5].\n\nRow10: [5,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8]. Leftmost5 (col0), rightmost8 (col12). Different. Ignored.\n\nRow11: [5,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Leftmost5 (col0), rightmost5 (col3). Same. Middle column6:0. Check columns5 and7. Column5:0, column7:8. So middle non-zero is8. Output row [5,0,8,0,5].\n\nRow12: [8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Leftmost8 (col0), rightmost8 (col3). Same. Middle column6:0. Check columns5 and7. Both zero. So output row [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Leftmost8 (col12), rightmost8 (col12). Same. Middle column6:0. So output row [8,0,0,0,8].\n\nNow, compiling all the valid output rows:\n\nRow2: [8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow5: [5,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow6: [5,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow7: [5,0,8,0,5]\n\nRow9: [5,0,8,0,5]\n\nRow11: [5,0,8,0,5]\n\nRow12: [8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow13: [8,0,0,0,8]\n\nBut this would give us an output with multiple rows. However, looking at the training examples, the outputs are symmetric and often have an odd number of rows. For example, Example0 has 5 rows, Example1 has5, Example2 has6.\n\nIn the test input's case, the valid rows are:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8] (from row2)\n\n[5,0,0,0,5] (row5 and row6)\n\n[5,0,8,0,5] (row7, row9, row11)\n\n[8,0,0,0,8] (row12 and row13)\n\nBut the output should be structured similar to the training examples, which often start and end with 8 rows and have 5 rows in between with possible middle 8s.\n\nSo the test output would likely be:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\nBut this has 7 rows, which may not fit. However, looking at Example2's output, which has6 rows, it's possible to have an even number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the unique rows and arranging them in a symmetric order. For example:\n\nStart with 8 rows, then 5 rows, then the middle rows with 8, then 5 rows, then 8 rows.\n\nBut how many layers are there in the test input's case.\n\nThe valid rows are:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8] (from row2, row12, row13)\n\n[5,0,0,0,5] (row5, row6)\n\n[5,0,8,0,5] (row7, row9, row11)\n\nSo if we arrange them as:\n\nFirst the 8 row,\n\nthen the 5 rows,\n\nthen the 5 rows with middle 8,\n\nthen the 5 rows again,\n\nthen the 8 rows.\n\nBut given that there are three instances of the 5-with-8 rows, the output may look like:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\nBut this has 7 rows, which doesn't match the training examples' patterns. However, Example2 has6 rows, so the number varies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output only includes unique rows once, but that's not the case in the training examples. For instance, Example0 has two [5,0,0,0,5] rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are ordered based on their occurrence in the input, but with possible duplicates. So the test output would be:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8] (row2)\n\n[5,0,0,0,5] (row5)\n\n[5,0,0,0,5] (row6)\n\n[5,0,8,0,5] (row7)\n\n[5,0,8,0,5] (row9)\n\n[5,0,8,0,5] (row11)\n\n[8,0,0,0,8] (row12)\n\n[8,0,0,0,8] (row13)\n\nBut this may be too many rows. However, the test input's output example may require grouping similar rows. For example, the three [5,0,8,0,5] rows could be merged into one, but that's unlikely.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\nExample0's output has:\n\nRow0:8,0,0,0,8\n\nRow1:5,0,0,0,5\n\nRow2:5,0,8,0,5\n\nRow3:5,0,0,0,5\n\nRow4:8,0,0,0,8\n\nSo it's symmetric, with the middle row having the 8.\n\nExample1's output is:\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[5,0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,8,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\n[8,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nWhich is also symmetric with the middle row having 8s.\n\nExample2's output has:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\nThis is symmetric, with two middle rows having 8s.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the test output should have a symmetric arrangement of rows starting and ending with 8s, with 5s in between and the middle rows having 8s.\n\nIn the test input's case, the valid rows are:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8] (row2, row12, row13)\n\n[5,0,0,0,5] (row5, row6)\n\n[5,0,8,0,5] (row7, row9, row11)\n\nTo form a symmetric output, we can arrange them as:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\nThis gives a symmetric output with 7 rows. However, looking at the training examples, the number of rows varies but is generally odd. Example2 has6 rows, which is even. So perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut the test input's output may have multiple middle rows with 8s, similar to Example2.\n\nThus, the final output for the test input would be:\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,8,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,0,5]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8]\n\nBut considering the test input's rows, there are three instances of [5,0,8,0,5]. To maintain symmetry, maybe they are arranged in the middle.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\n[5, 0, 8, 0, 5]\n\n[5, 0, 8, 0, 5]\n\n[5, 0, 8, 0, 5]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nBut the training examples have varying numbers of rows, so this is plausible.",
