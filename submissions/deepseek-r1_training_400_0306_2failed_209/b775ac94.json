        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a grid of numbers, and the output is another grid. The task is to find the transformation applied to the input to get the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a lot of zeros, but there are some non-zero numbers towards the bottom. For instance, in row 9 (0-based index), there's [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, ...], and the corresponding output row has [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, ...]. Hmm. It looks like numbers are being added around the existing non-zero elements. Like, the 2 and 1 in the input might be generating some surrounding numbers in the output. Maybe some sort of expansion or neighboring cell modification?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a structure with 2s and 8, 4, 3. The output shows that around those numbers, other numbers are added. For instance, the row with 2s in the input has 8s added in the output. Also, the 4 and 3 in the input are surrounded by more 4s and 3s in the output. This seems like each non-zero number is causing certain patterns around it. Maybe each number is creating a cross or a diamond shape around itself in the output?\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has 8s and 4, 6. The output adds 4s next to the 8s, and 6s next to the 6. Also, there's a 1 in the input that's surrounded by 1s in the output. So perhaps each number is expanding in all directions (up, down, left, right) by one cell, placing the same number around it. But wait, in Example 0, the 7s in the input turn into more 7s and 4s. Wait, that might not fit. Let me check.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, in row 10, there's [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 4, 0, ...]. The output row 10 is [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 4, 4, 0, ...]. So around the 7s and 4 in the input, the output adds 3s and 4s. That's a bit confusing. Maybe each number has a specific surrounding pattern. For example, 7s might generate 3s and 4s around them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is creating a \"border\" around each cluster of numbers. Like, each non-zero cell in the input causes adjacent cells in the output to be filled with a certain value. But the values added depend on the original number. For example, 7 in the input leads to 7 and 4 in adjacent cells. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2s, and the output adds 8s around them. Then, the 8 in the input is surrounded by more 8s. The 4 and 3 in the input lead to 4s and 3s around them. So maybe each number in the input propagates its value to adjacent cells in the output, but perhaps with some modification. Like, when a number n is present in the input, the output places n in the adjacent cells. But in Example 0, the 2 and 1 in the input row 9 generate 3,4, etc. So maybe there's a mapping where 1\u21922, 2\u21923, etc., but that might not fit all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the original input and some expansion. For example, each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross shape (up, down, left, right) of the same number in the output. But looking at Example 0's output row 10, the input has 7,7,4 and the output has 7,7,4,4. But there's also 3s and 4s added. So maybe overlapping expansions from different numbers?\n\nWait, maybe each number in the input generates a plus sign of the same number in the output. For instance, a 2 in the input would place 2s in the cells above, below, left, and right. But when multiple numbers are adjacent, their expansions might overlap. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's input row 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,8,0,...]. The output row 8 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,8,8,...]. So the 8 in the input's row 8 column 8 (assuming 0-based) would generate 8s around it. Similarly, the 2s next to it generate 2s around, but in the output, they also have 8s. Hmm, but in the output row 8, the 8 from input might have generated 8s to the right and left, but in the output, it's [8,8,8,8,8]. That's more like a cross plus maybe diagonals? Or perhaps a 3x3 square around each non-zero cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking each non-zero cell in the input and placing a 3x3 square of the same number centered at that cell. But that would cause a lot of overlapping. Let's test this hypothesis:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 at (row 6, column 4) (assuming 0-based). If we place a 3x3 square of 2s around it, then in the output, rows 5-7, columns 3-5 would be filled with 2s. But in the output, row 7 (input row 6) has [0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0...] and the output row 7 has [0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,8,0,8...]. Wait, this doesn't fit. So maybe not a 3x3 square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell in the input adds its value to the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) in the output. So for each cell (i,j) in the input with value v, the output cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) get v added. But in the examples, the numbers don't add up; they replace. For example, in Example 0, input row 9 has 2 and 1. The output row 9 has 3,4, etc. So that might not be it.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a 8,8 in rows 1 and 2, columns 7 and 8. The output adds 4,4 to columns 11 and 12 in those rows. So 8 in input leads to 4 in output adjacent cells? That could be a specific mapping: 8\u21924. Similarly, in Example 0, the 7s in input lead to 7s and 4s. So maybe each number has a specific neighboring number that it generates. For example:\n\n- 1 generates 2s around it.\n- 2 generates 3s around it.\n- 3 generates 4s around it.\n- 4 generates something else.\n- 7 generates 4s around it.\n- 8 generates 8s around it?\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the 8 in row 8 column 8 generates 8s in the output. In the output row 7, columns 8-12 are 8s. But input's row 8 column 8 is 8, so in the output, adjacent cells to 8 get 8? That might fit. Similarly, in Example 2, the 8s in input generate 8s in adjacent cells. Wait, but in Example 2's output, the 8s in input rows 1 and 2 columns 7-8 are still present, and there are additional 4s in columns 11-12. So maybe 8s generate 8s in adjacent cells and 4s further out?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number in the input is part of a chain where each number n in the input causes adjacent cells in the output to have n+1. For example:\n\n- Input 1 \u2192 output places 2s around it.\n- Input 2 \u2192 3s around.\n- Input 3 \u21924s.\n- Input 4 \u21925s.\nBut in Example 1, input 4 leads to output 4s around. Hmm, no. Because in Example 1, the input row 9 has 4 and 3. The output row 9 has 4,4,3,3. So 4 in input leads to 4s around. So that contradicts the +1 idea.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross shape (up, down, left, right) in the output with the same value. Then, overlapping areas might show the sum or the maximum. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 10, there are 7,7,4. If each 7 creates a cross of 7s, then overlapping would result in 7s. But in the output, those cells have 7,7,4,4 and also some 3s and 4s nearby. So that doesn't fit. Maybe the cross is not the same number but a different one.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero cell in the input is replaced by a 3x3 grid of numbers where the center is the original number, and the surrounding cells are numbers related to it. For example, 2 becomes:\n\n2 2 2\n\n2 2 2\n\n2 2 2\n\nBut that would create a larger grid, but the output grids have the same dimensions as the input. So perhaps overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, think of each non-zero cell in the input as a seed that creates a certain pattern in the output. For example:\n\n- 1 creates a vertical line of 1s.\n- 2 creates a horizontal line.\nBut how to reconcile with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by applying a convolution-like kernel where each non-zero cell in the input affects neighboring cells in the output based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input row 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,4,0,0,0]. The output row 3 is the same as input, but in the output row 1, columns 11-12 are 4s. How does that happen? The input's 8 and 4 in row 3 may generate 4s in row 1, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, the 8 in the input might generate 8s in adjacent cells, and the 4 in input generates 4s in adjacent cells. But in row 3, the 8 is in column 9 (0-based?), and the output row 1 has 4s in columns 11-12, which might not be adjacent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to mirror the input in some way. For example, in Example 0, the output seems to have some symmetry. The numbers are arranged in a way that might be a reflection or rotation. But the input and output dimensions are the same, so it's not a rotation.\n\nAnother angle: Looking for the output to include the input plus some additional cells filled based on their proximity to the original. For example, in Example 0's input, the 2 and 1 in row 9 are surrounded by 3 and 4 in the output. Maybe the rule is that each non-zero cell v in the input places v+1 in adjacent cells. But in Example 0, a 1 would become 2, and a 2 would become 3. Looking at row 9 in input: [..., 2,1,0...]. Output row 9: [...,3,4,0,...]. Wait, the 2 in input is next to a 1. The output has 3 and 4. If 2 becomes 3 and 1 becomes 2, but overlapping cells sum? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell v in the input adds v to the adjacent cells in the output, but the output cells can be the sum of all contributions. For example, if a cell in the output is adjacent to a 2 and a 1, it would be 2+1=3. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 9, the 2 and 1 are next to each other. The output row 9 has a 3 and 4. The cell between them (position where 2 and 1 are adjacent) would be 2+1=3. Then the cell to the right of 1 would be 1, but in the output, it's 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe not additive.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input row 7: [0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,...]. The output row 7 becomes [0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,...]. The 2s in the input are followed by 8s in the output. So maybe 2 in input leads to 8 in adjacent cells. That's a possible mapping. Then, the 8 in the input (row 8 column 8) leads to 8s around it. So 2\u21928, 8\u21928.\n\nIn Example 0, the 7s in input lead to 7s and 4s. So 7\u21927 and 4? Hmm, perhaps each number n in the input generates a cross of (n-3) in adjacent cells. For example, 7-3=4, so 4s around. 2-3= -1, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, n mod something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number in the input causes adjacent cells in the output to be filled with their own number plus the original number. For example, 2 in input leads to 2 in adjacent cells. But in Example 1, the 2s are followed by 8s, so that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is created by expanding each number in the input into a diamond shape. For instance, each number creates a diamond (Manhattan distance <=1) around it in the output. But in Example 0's output, the 3s and 4s form such patterns. But how do the numbers relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, each number in the input is part of a larger structure in the output. For example, in Example 1's input, the 2s form a cross, and in the output, they're surrounded by 8s. Maybe each number has a specific \"aura\" around it in the output. For example, 2 creates 8s around it, 8 creates 8s, 4 creates 3s, etc.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input where there's a 6. The output has 6s next to it. So 6 generates 6s around. In Example 0, 7 generates 7s and 4s. Wait, this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell in the input is the center of a 3x3 square in the output, where the edges are set to the same value as the center. So, for example, a cell with value v in the input would create a 3x3 square of v in the output. But overlapping squares would overwrite each other. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 7, the 2s form a horizontal line. If each 2 creates a 3x3 square of 2s in the output, then overlapping would create a larger horizontal bar. But in the output row 7, the 2s are followed by 8s, so this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: The output is generated by applying a cellular automaton-like rule, where each cell in the output depends on its neighbors in the input. For example, if a cell in the input has a non-zero value, then its neighboring cells in the output take specific values based on the original.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input and some form of dilation. Dilation in image processing expands regions by adding pixels to the boundaries. If each non-zero pixel is dilated by one pixel, then the output would have the original plus adjacent cells. But again, the values don't match. For example, in Example 0's input, the 2 and 1 are next to each other. If dilated, the output would have those plus adjacent cells as 2 and 1, but in the output, there are 3 and 4.\n\nWait, maybe each non-zero cell in the input turns into a cross of the next number in a sequence. Like, 1 becomes 2 in adjacent cells, 2 becomes 3, etc. But in Example 1, the 2s in input generate 8s, which breaks that sequence. So perhaps there's a different mapping.\n\nLooking back at Example 1:\n\nInput row 8 has 8. Output row 8 has 8,8. Input row 9 has 4 and 3. Output row 9 has 4,4 and 3,3. So maybe each number in the input is duplicated to the right and left? Or for each number in the input, the output has the same number to the left and right. For example, a 8 in input leads to 8,8 in output. But how does that fit with other examples.\n\nIn Example 0's row 10, input has 7,7,4. The output has 7,7,4,4. So perhaps each number in the input is duplicated to the right. But in row 9 of Example 0's input, the 2 and 1 become 3 and 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the output is a mirror image of the input with certain transformations. For example, the output might be a flipped version with some number changes. But in Example 0, the input's 2 and 1 are in the middle, and the output has 3,4 in the same area. Flipping doesn't explain that.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input and its neighbors. For instance, each cell in the output is the sum of its neighbors in the input. But that would require a different calculation for each cell, which seems complex. But looking at Example 0's output row 9, the 3 and 4 might be sums of adjacent input cells. For example, the cell with 3 in output could be sum of input's left, right, up, and down cells. But in input row 9, the cells around 2 and 1 are zeros except for their immediate neighbors. So sum of neighbors for the cell where 3 is in output might be 2 (from the input's left neighbor) plus 1 (from the input's right neighbor) equals 3. Then 3+1=4? Hmm, maybe. Let's check:\n\nFor Example 0's input row 9, the cells are [...,0,2,1,0...]. The output row 9 has [...,3,4,0...]. So the cell to the left of 2 in the input (which is 0) would have output cell as the sum of its neighbors. Wait, maybe the output cell (i,j) is the sum of the input cell (i,j)'s four adjacent cells. For instance, output cell (9, 16) (assuming 0-based index) would be the sum of input cells around (9,16). Let's see:\n\nIn input row 9, the 2 is at position 16, and 1 at 17. The cell to the left of 2 is 15 (0), to the right is 17 (1), above is row 8, column 16 (0), and below is row 10, column 16 (0). Summing these: 0 +1 +0 +0 =1. But the output cell in row 9, column 16 is 3. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell is the maximum of the input's neighboring cells. For example, output cell (9,16) would look at input cells (8,16), (10,16), (9,15), (9,17). Those are 0,0,0,1. The maximum is 1, but the output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let me look for another pattern. Notice that in Example 0's output, the numbers 3 and 4 are prevalent. In the input, there's a 2 and 1. Maybe the output adds numbers around them in a certain way. For example, 2 generates 3s around, and 1 generates 4s. But that seems arbitrary. Or, the numbers are transformed based on their positions relative to others.\n\nAlternatively, each number in the input is replaced by a different number, and that number's neighbors are filled with a related number. For example, 2 becomes 3, and then neighbors of 3 are filled with 4. But this is speculative.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again: Input has a 2, and output adds 8s around it. Then, in the same example, input has a 4 and 3, and output adds 4s and 3s around. So maybe certain numbers generate their own values in adjacent cells, while others generate different numbers. For example, 2\u21928, 3\u21923, 4\u21924, 8\u21928.\n\nBut why would 2 generate 8? That seems arbitrary. Maybe there's a numerical relationship. For example, 2*4=8. So 2 in input generates 8 (2*4) in adjacent cells. Then, 4 in input generates 4*4=16? But there's no 16 in the output. Alternatively, 2+6=8. But 3+5=8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each number in the input is part of a group, and their adjacent cells are filled with the next group number. For example, numbers 1-4 are group A, 5-8 group B. But this is vague.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, around the 7s in the input, there are 7s and 4s. 7-3=4. In Example 1's input, 2 leads to 8. 2*4=8. So perhaps each number in the input generates adjacent cells with their value multiplied by 4. For 7, 7-3=4. But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input and a shifted version. For example, input shifted up, down, left, right, and combined. But how would that create new numbers.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output row 7:\n\nInput row 7 is all zeros. Output row 7 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,...]. The original non-zero cells are in row 9. So this might suggest that the output is shifted upwards. But row 7 is two rows above row 9. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a mirror image along the vertical axis. But comparing input and output rows, it's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: The output includes the original input numbers plus their adjacent cells filled with a certain pattern based on the original number. For example, each number v in the input fills adjacent cells with v+1. Let's test:\n\nIn Example 1's input row 7, the 2s would generate 3s around. But in the output, there are 8s. So that's not matching. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, each number in the input is replaced by a different number in the output, and the adjacent cells are filled with another number. For example, 2 becomes 8, 4 becomes 3, etc. But I need to find a pattern in the mappings.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput has 2 and 1 in row 9. Output has 3,4, etc. Let's assume 2\u21923 and 1\u21924. Then, in Example 1, 2\u21928. So this doesn't hold. So maybe the mapping is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the digits in the input affects the output. For example, 2+1=3, which is part of the output. But not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's a common pattern across all examples.\n\nIn Example 0's output, there are numbers 3 and 4 around the original 2 and 1. In Example 1's output, 8s are around the original 2s. In Example 2's output, 4s and 6s are around the original 8 and 6.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has an 8 and 4 in row 3. The output adds 4s in row 1, columns 11-12. The 8 is in column 9 of row 3. The 4s are two columns to the right. Maybe the 8 in the input generates 4s two columns to the right. That's a specific rule. But how does that apply to other examples.\n\nAlternatively, each number n in the input causes a certain number of cells to the right to be filled with n+ something. For example, 8 generates 4 (8/2=4) two cells to the right. In Example 0, 7 generates 4 (7-3=4) to the right. In Example 1, 2 generates 8 (2*4=8) to the right. This could be a pattern: for each number n in the input, the output places (n * 4) in cells to the right, left, above, or below. But how.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking each non-zero cell in the input and, for each direction (up, down, left, right), adding a new cell with value v = (original_value + direction_number), where direction_number is 0 for up, 1 for right, etc. But this is speculative.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input row 7 has 2s. The output row 7 has 2s followed by 8s. So perhaps each 2 in the input leads to an 8 in the next row. But in the output, the 8s are in row 7, which is the same row as the input. So maybe not.\n\nAnother observation: The output often has the same numbers as the input but with additional numbers around them. For example, in Example 1's input row 8 has 8, and output row 8 has 8,8. So the 8 is duplicated to the right. The input row 9 has 4 and 3, and output row 9 has 4,4 and 3,3. So each number is duplicated to the right. But in Example 0's input row 9, 2 and 1 become 3 and 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each number in the input is replaced by the next number in the sequence, and adjacent cells are filled with the next+1. For example, 2\u21923, and adjacent cells get 4. But in Example 0, the output has 3 and 4 next to 2 and 1. But 1 would become 2. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to find a rule that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the non-zero cells in the output seem to be in positions adjacent to the non-zero cells in the input, but with different values. For example:\n\nIn Example 0's input, 2 and 1 are adjacent. In the output, there's a 3 and 4. So 2+1=3, and 2*2=4? Not sure.\n\nIn Example 1's input, 2s are followed by 8s. 2*4=8. So perhaps each number n in the input leads to adjacent cells filled with n*4.\n\nIn Example 2's input, 8 leads to 4 (8/2=4), and 6 leads to 6. So maybe even numbers are divided by 2, while odd numbers remain. But in Example 0, 7/2 is 3.5, but output has 4. Maybe rounded up.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nn in input \u2192 adjacent cells in output have value n * something.\n\nExample 1: 2 \u21928 (2*4), 4\u21924 (4*1), 3\u21923 (3*1), 8\u21928 (8*1).\n\nExample 0: 2\u21923 (2*1.5), 1\u21924 (1*4). Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for a pattern in how the output cells are positioned relative to the input cells. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 3s and 4s are positioned around the original 2 and 1. The 3s are to the left and right of the 2, and the 4s are to the left and right of the 1. Maybe each number n in the input places n+1 to the left and n+2 to the right. So for 2, left is 3, right is 4. For 1, left is 2, right is 3. But in Example 0's output, the 1 in input has a 4 to the left. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output cells are a combination of the input cells and their diagonal neighbors. For example, a cell in the output is the sum of its diagonal neighbors in the input. But again, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a combination of multiple layers. Each non-zero input cell contributes to certain layers in the output. For example, numbers 1-4 contribute to different layers, and the output is their combination.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to generalize.\n\nLet's try to find a rule that applies to all examples:\n\nObserving Example 0's output for row 9:\n\nInput: [..., 2, 1, ...]\n\nOutput: [...,3,4,0, ...]\n\nSo the 2 in the input has a 3 to the left and a 4 to the right. The 1 has a 0 to the right. Wait, but maybe the 2's left is 3 and right is 4. The 1's left is 4 and right is 0. Not sure.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 7, the 2s lead to 8s to the right. So perhaps each number n in the input places 4n to the right. 2*4=8. 4*1=4. In Example 0's 2, 2*4=8, but output has 3 and 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking each non-zero cell and placing the number in the adjacent cells with some transformation. For example, left neighbor gets n+1, right neighbor gets n+2, up neighbor n+3, down neighbor n+4. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input where there's a 6, the output has 6s to the right and left. So 6 leads to 6s in adjacent cells. So maybe numbers >=6 stay the same in adjacent cells, while lower numbers are transformed.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Perhaps I should look for a pattern in the numbers:\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput 2 and 1 \u2192 output 3 and 4.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput 2 \u2192 output 8.\n\nInput 4 and 3 \u2192 output 4 and 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput 8 \u2192 output 4.\n\nInput 6 \u2192 output 6.\n\nPossible pattern: For even numbers:\n\n- If even and >=4, output the same number.\n\n- If even and <4, output multiplied by 4.\n\nFor odd numbers:\n\n- Output the next even number.\n\nBut 1\u21922, but in Example 0, 1\u21924.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nNumbers 1\u21924, 2\u21928, 3\u21923, 4\u21924, 6\u21926, 7\u21927, 8\u21924.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. For Example 0's input 7 leads to 7 and 4 in the output. So perhaps 7\u21927 and 4. Maybe higher numbers are split into lower numbers. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each number in the input is replaced by the number of letters in its English name. For example:\n\n1 \u2192 \"one\" \u2192 3 letters, but in Example 0, 1 becomes 4. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nLooking at all examples, it seems that non-zero cells in the input cause certain patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the 2s generate 8s around them. The 4 and 3 generate 4s and 3s around. In Example 2, 8s generate 4s around. So perhaps each number has a specific value that it places in adjacent cells. For instance:\n\n- 2 \u21928\n\n- 3\u21924\n\n- 4\u21924\n\n- 7\u21927 and 4\n\n- 8\u21928 and/or 4\n\n- 1\u2192 ?\n\nIn Example 0, 1 is next to a 2. The output has 4. Maybe 1 generates 4. So:\n\n1 \u21924\n\n2 \u21928\n\n3\u21923\n\n4\u21924\n\n7\u21927 and 4\n\n8\u21928 and 4\n\nBut how to confirm this.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 9 has 4 and 3. Output row 9 has 4,4 and 3,3. So 4 generates 4, 3 generates 3.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the 8s generate 8s in the same rows and 4s in new positions. So maybe 8 generates both 8 and 4.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each non-zero cell in the input:\n\n- If the cell is 1, place 4 in adjacent cells.\n\n- If the cell is 2, place 8 in adjacent cells.\n\n- If the cell is 3, place 4 in adjacent cells.\n\n- If the cell is 4, place 4 in adjacent cells.\n\n- If the cell is 7, place 7 and 4.\n\n- If the cell is 8, place 8 and 4.\n\n- If the cell is 6, place 6.\n\nThis seems possible. Let's test this:\n\nExample 1's input row 7 has 2s. The output has 8s around them. Which fits 2\u21928.\n\nExample 2's input 8 generates 4s in output, which fits 8\u21924.\n\nExample 0's input 7s generate 7s and 4s. Fits.\n\nExample 0's input 1 generates 4. The output has 4 next to the 1. Fits.\n\nExample 0's input 2 generates 8. But in the output, next to the 2, there's a 3 and 4. Wait, this contradicts. So perhaps this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are mapped as follows:\n\n1 \u21922\n\n2 \u21923\n\n3 \u21924\n\n4 \u21924\n\n7 \u21927 and 4\n\n8 \u21928 and 4\n\nSo in Example 0's input, the 2 and 1 become 3 and 2. But the output has 3 and 4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the sum of the input number and their position. For example, the row number plus the column number plus the input value. But this is unlikely to fit all cases.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the pressure to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the input, in the output, place the same number in adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and the cell itself. Then, if the number is even, add 4 to the adjacent cells. Or some variation of this.\n\nAlternatively, based on the examples, each non-zero cell in the input adds the same number to the adjacent cells in the output. For example, a 2 in input adds 2s around, but when multiple cells are adjacent, their contributions sum. However, in Example 1, the output has 8s around 2s. So maybe the numbers are multiplied by 4. 2 *4=8. 4*1=4. 3*1=3. So:\n\nFor each non-zero cell v in the input, the output's adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are set to v *4. If v is even, multiply by 4; if odd, keep as is. But 1*4=4, which matches Example 0's output where 1 generates 4. 2*4=8, which matches Example 1. 3*4=12, but in Example 1, the 3 generates 3s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, only even numbers are multiplied by 4. Odd numbers are kept. So 2\u21928, 4\u21924*4=16 (but in Example 1's output, 4 remains 4), which contradicts.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll assume that each non-zero cell in the input adds a cross of the same number in the output, and overlapping cells sum their values. For example, in Example 1's input, the 2s generate 2s around, which when summed would create higher numbers. But this doesn't explain why 2 becomes 8. Alternatively, each cell in the output is the count of the number of times it's adjacent to non-zero cells in the input multiplied by a certain factor. For example, if a cell is adjacent to two 2s, it would be 2*2=4. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the examples, the most consistent pattern is that non-zero numbers in the input generate a cross of their value multiplied by 4 in the output. So 2 becomes 8, 1 becomes 4, 3 becomes 12, etc. But this doesn't hold for all cases. For example, in Example 1, 4 and 3 generate 4s and 3s, not 16 and 12.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the same as the input numbers but with certain shifts. For example, shifting the input grid up by two rows and right by three columns. But this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I think the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input generates a cross (up, down, left, right) of the same value in the output, but overlapping cells might have their values combined. For example, if two cells generate the same position, the value is the sum. But in the examples, this doesn't seem to align. However, given the time, I'll proceed with this approach for the test input.\n\nFor the test input, I'll look for non-zero cells and generate crosses around them. For example, a 8 in the input will generate 8s in the adjacent cells. A 2 will generate 2s around, etc. But according to the training examples, certain numbers like 2 generate 8s. So perhaps there's a mapping table. Given the test input has numbers like 8, 3, 2, 4, 1, etc., I'll try to apply the mapping observed in the examples:\n\n2 \u21928\n\n3 \u21924\n\n4 \u21924\n\n1 \u21924\n\n8 \u21928\n\nSo applying this:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the test input:\n\n- If the value is 1, place 4 in adjacent cells.\n\n- If 2, place 8.\n\n- If 3, place4.\n\n- If 4, place4.\n\n- If 8, place8.\n\nAlso, keep the original numbers in their positions.\n\nSo let's process the test input:\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the 8 at column 5 (0-based) will generate 8s in up, down, left, right.

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the training examples. Let me look through each example carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a bunch of zeros and some numbers scattered. The output seems to add more numbers around the existing ones. For instance, in row 10 of the input, there's [2,1,0...], and in the output, that row becomes [7,7,4...]. Hmm. Maybe the numbers are being expanded or mirrored. Also, looking at the 8 in the input's row 21, the output in row 19 has 8s spreading out. It seems like numbers are propagating in some direction, perhaps diagonally or adjacent cells.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a structure with 2s and 8,3. The output adds 8s and 4s around them. For example, the row with [8,0] becomes [8,8,8...]. So maybe each number is creating a pattern around itself. Like, a number n creates copies of itself in neighboring cells, or maybe a different number based on n.\n\nExample 2's input has 8s and 6. The output adds 4s and 6s. For instance, the 6 in the input's row 4 is surrounded by 6s in the output. Also, the 8s in the input's row 1 and 2 lead to 8s and 4s in the output. So perhaps each number generates certain other numbers in adjacent cells. Maybe higher numbers generate lower ones or specific sequences.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might involve each non-zero cell spreading its value or related values to adjacent cells. But how exactly? Let's think about the direction. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 7s and 4s seem to spread to the right and maybe down. In Example 1, the 8s spread to the right and up. Maybe each number has a direction associated with it. Like 8 moves up, 2 moves left, etc. Or maybe each number generates a specific pattern in certain directions.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input row 7 has 2s arranged in a line. The output in that row becomes surrounded by 2s and 8s. The 8 in the input's row 8 leads to more 8s and 3s. Maybe the numbers are expanding in a certain direction, like moving to the right or left, and possibly creating a pattern of their own number or a related one. Alternatively, each number could represent a direction of movement, and the output shows where they end up after moving.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the transformation is applying a cellular automaton rule. Each cell's new value depends on its neighbors. But the outputs seem to add new numbers around existing ones, which isn't typical for most automata. Alternatively, maybe each number is a particle that moves in a certain direction, leaving a trail or affecting adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at the test input, there's an 8 in row 3, then 8s in row 4 and 5. Also, a 2 and 3 in row 6 and 7. The output would need to apply the same pattern. For example, the 8s might spread to adjacent cells, creating more 8s or related numbers like 4 or 3. The 2 and 3 could generate their own patterns. The 1s in row 7 might spread to create more 1s or another number nearby.\n\nWait, in the training examples, when there's a number, it's surrounded by the same number or another in the output. For example, in Example 1, the 3 in the input's row 9 becomes 3s and 4s around. The 4s in the output might be generated by the 3. So maybe each number n generates n in adjacent cells, but sometimes a different number based on a rule. Or perhaps each number n generates a certain number of steps in a direction. For example, 8 might move upward, creating 8s in the cells above. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the input has an 8 in row 21 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). The output has 8s in row 19, which is two rows up. So maybe 8 moves up two cells. Then, the 2 and 3 in row 22 of the input (output in row 21 and 22) might move in different directions. For example, 2 moves left, 3 moves right.\n\nAlternatively, each number could have a direction and distance. For instance, 8 moves up by two cells. Then, in the test input, the 8 in row 3 would generate 8s two rows up. But row 3 minus 2 is row 1. Let's see the test input's 8 is in row 3 (third row from top?), maybe zero-indexed. So moving up two rows would place 8s in row 1. But looking at the test input's row 3, 4,5: rows 3 has 0,0,0,0,8,0..., row 4 has 0,8,8,8..., row 5 has 0,0,8,0,8... So in the output, the 8s might spread upward. For example, each 8 generates another 8 in the cell two rows above. Then, the existing 8s would create new 8s higher up. Similarly, the 2 and 3 in row 6 and 7 might generate their own numbers in specific directions.\n\nAlternatively, numbers could be representing arrows. For example, 8 could be up, 2 could be left, 4 right, etc. Then, each number in the input is an arrow pointing in a direction, and the output is where the particles end up after moving in that direction. So a cell with 8 (up) would move up, and the output marks the new position. But in the examples, the output has multiple numbers added around, not just one. So perhaps each number leaves a trail or affects adjacent cells based on their direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number represents a direction and a distance. For instance, 8 means move up 2 cells, 4 means move right 1, etc. Then, the output shows the path taken. For example, in Example 0, the 8 in row 21 (if rows are 0-indexed) moves up 2 cells to row 19, and leaves 8s along the way. But looking at the output, there are 8s in row 19, 20, and 21. Maybe the 8 in the input creates a line upwards.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to find a consistent pattern across examples. Let's take Example 2. The input has a 6 in row 4. The output has 6s in row 5 and 6 adjacent to it. So maybe 6 spreads to the right and down? Or maybe each number n spreads in a certain direction determined by n. For instance, 8 could be up, 4 right, 6 down, etc. So when a number is present, it creates a copy in the direction it's pointing. Then, those copies also do the same, leading to lines of numbers in that direction.\n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a 8 in row 8. The output in row 7 and 8 has multiple 8s. So if 8 is up, then the 8 in row 8 would create an 8 in row 7 (up one cell). But the output has 8s in row 7, 8, and 9. Hmm, maybe each step, the number propagates in its direction. So for each 8, in the output, it moves up one cell, and the original stays. So after one step, you have the original and the new position. But how does that explain the multiple 8s in the output?\n\nAlternatively, each number is a vector, and the output shows the original plus the cells in the direction of the vector. For example, 8 is up, so each 8 in the input would add 8s in the cells above. But in Example 0, the 8 in the input (row 21) leads to 8s in rows 19, 20, and 21 of the output. Maybe each number n moves n cells in a certain direction. Wait, 8 moving up 8 cells? But that's not possible given the grid size. Alternatively, the number itself indicates how many steps to take. For example, 8 means move up 2 steps (since 8 divided by 4 is 2?), but this is speculative.\n\nAnother approach: look at the numbers in the output and see if they relate to the input numbers. For example, in Example 0, input has a 7 and 4 in row 10. The output has 7,7,4. Maybe 7 and 4 are adjacent in the input, and in the output, they spread to the right. Similarly, 3 and 4 in the input (Example 0 row 11) become 3,3,3,4,4,4. So it's like each number is duplicated to the right and possibly other directions.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the row 7 has 2,2,2,2,2. The output row 7 has 2,2,2,2,2 surrounded by 8s. The 8 in row 8's input leads to 8s in the output. So maybe each number n creates a cross or plus sign around it, with n and other numbers. Or perhaps each number has a specific shape it generates.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be mirroring the existing numbers. For example, the input has a certain pattern, and the output mirrors it horizontally or vertically. But in Example 0, the input's 2 and 1 in row 9 become 2,2,1 in the output. So maybe mirrored to the right. But in other examples, like Example 2, the 6 in the input is surrounded by 6s in the output, which could be expansion.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is the input plus some sort of convolution. For instance, each cell in the output is the sum of the input cell and its neighbors. But the numbers in the output don't seem to be sums. For example, in Example 0, input row 10 has 7,7,4. The output row 10 has 7,7,4,4,0. Maybe the 4 is being spread to the right.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell in the input is replaced by a 2x2 block of the same number in the output. But that doesn't fit all examples. For instance, in Example 1's input row 9 has a 4 and 3, which in the output become 4,4 and 3,3. So maybe each number is duplicated to the right and down.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input row 3, which has an 8 in column 10. The output row 3 has 8,4 in columns 10 and 11. Wait, 8 and 4. Maybe 8 generates 4s next to it. But in Example 0, 7 and 4 are next to each other, leading to 7,7,4,4. So perhaps each number n generates a copy of itself and a number lower by 3 (since 7-3=4, 8-4=4?). Not sure. Alternatively, each number is followed by its factors.\n\nAlternatively, each number is part of a sequence. For example, 8 leads to 8 and 4, then 4 leads to 4 and 2, etc. So in the output, each number n is followed by n and n/2, perhaps. Let's check. In Example 0's row 10: input is 7,7,4. Output is 7,7,4,4. So 7 stays, 4 stays. In Example 1's input row 9 has 4 and 3. Output row 9 has 4,4,3,3. So they duplicate. Hmm, but how does that fit with 8s leading to more 8s and 3s?\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, row 8 has 2,2,8. The output row 8 has 2,2,8,8. So maybe the 8 is duplicated, but the 2s stay. Then in row 7 of the output, the 2s are followed by 8s. So perhaps adjacent numbers influence each other. Like, a 2 next to an 8 turns into more 8s. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me try to look for a specific rule. Let's take Example 2. Input row 8 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, ...]. The output row 8 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 2,4...], but row 9 in the output has [0,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4...]. So the 2 and 4 in the input are expanded into multiple 2s and 4s in the output. Similarly, the 6 in the input's row 4 is surrounded by 6s in the output. So perhaps each number n is replaced by a block of n's. But the blocks vary in size and shape.\n\nAlternatively, each number in the input is the center of a cross in the output, with the same number extending in four directions. For example, a 8 would have 8s in the cell above, below, left, and right. But in Example 0's row 10, the 7,7,4 in the input leads to 7,7,4,4 in the output. So maybe each number extends to the right and down. For instance, each non-zero cell copies its value to the cell to the right and below, creating a 2x2 block. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1's input row 9 has 4 and 3. The output row 9 has 4,4,3,3. Then row 10 has 4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3. So it's like each number is duplicated to the right and down. So a single 4 becomes a 2x2 block of 4s, and the 3 becomes a 2x2 block of 3s. Then, row 10 in the output would have 4s and 3s spreading further. Similarly, in Example 0's row 10, 7 and 4 become 7,7 and 4,4. Then in the output, maybe they spread further. But in Example 0's output row 10, there are more 7s and 4s. Hmm.\n\nIf this is the case, then the rule could be that each non-zero cell duplicates its value to the right and down, creating a 2x2 block. Then, those new cells also duplicate, leading to larger blocks. But in the outputs, the spreading seems to be limited. For example, in Example 0's row 10, the 7,7,4 in the input become 7,7,4,4. Then in the next step, maybe those new cells duplicate again. But how many times? Because the output examples show varying spreads. Maybe the duplication happens once, so each cell creates copies to the right and down once. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 7: [2,2,2,2,2]. The output row 7: [2,2,2,2,2] with 8s around. So maybe after duplicating to the right and down, but also interacting with other numbers. This is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each number in the input creates a diamond-shaped pattern around itself in the output. For example, a number n creates n in all cells at a certain Manhattan distance. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers represent different colors, and the output is a flood fill or expansion. For example, each number fills adjacent cells in some direction. But the direction might vary per number. For example, 8 expands upwards, 2 to the left, 4 to the right, 6 down, etc. So each number spreads in its direction, and the output is the original plus the spread.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8 in the input's lower rows would spread upwards, leading to 8s in higher rows. Similarly, the 7 and 4 would spread to the right. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 10: 7,7,4. If 7 spreads to the right and 4 spreads to the right, the output would have 7,7,4,4. Then, maybe the 7s also spread upwards. But in the output row 10, the 7s and 4s are present, and the rows above have 2s and other numbers. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each number has a certain number of steps it can spread. For example, 8 spreads up two cells, 7 spreads right one cell, etc. But this requires knowing the mapping of numbers to directions and steps.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the positions of the numbers in input and output to see how they shift. For example, in Example 0, the 8 in row 21 of the input (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top) appears in row 19 of the output. That's two rows up. So 8 moves up two. The 2 and 3 in row 22 of the input appear in rows 21 and 22 of the output. So 2 and 3 might move up one row. Let's check other numbers.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 8 in row 8 moves to row 7 and 9 in the output. So maybe 8 moves up and down? Or perhaps the direction is different. Alternatively, 8 moves up, and the other numbers move in different directions. For example, 2 moves left, 3 moves right, 4 moves down, etc.\n\nIf that's the case, then the output is generated by each number moving in their respective directions. For example:\n\n- 8 moves up two cells.\n- 2 moves left.\n- 3 moves right.\n- 4 moves down.\n- 1 moves down.\n- 7 moves right.\n- 6 moves down.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's look at Example 2. The input has a 6 in row 4, column 10. The output has 6 in row 4, column 10 and 6s in rows 5 and 6, columns 11 and 12. So if 6 moves down and right, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the 6 spreads down and right, creating a diagonal. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each number represents a direction and the number of steps. For example, 8 is up, 2 is left, 4 is right, 6 is down. Then, each number in the input moves in that direction by one step, leaving a trail. So an 8 in the input moves up one cell, and the output has the original and the new position. For example, in Example 0's 8, moving up two steps would require multiple moves. But how?\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's look at another example. In Example 2's input row 8 has a 2 and 4. The output row 9 has 2,2,2,2 and 4,4,4,4. So maybe the 2 and 4 each spread to the right and down. The 2 in input row 8 (position 4) spreads to columns 4,5,6,7 in row 9. Similarly, the 4 in position 5 of row 8 spreads to columns 5,6,7,8 in row 9. So each number spreads to the right and down, creating a 4-cell block. Then, each number in the input creates a 2x2 block in the output, and existing numbers in the output may combine.\n\nIf that's the rule, then for the test input, each number would spread to form a 2x2 block. Let's check the test input's 8s. For example, the 8 in row 3 (third row) would spread to the right and down, creating 8s in row 3 and 4, columns around. Similarly, the 8s in rows 4 and 5 would spread further. The 2 and 3 in row 6 and 7 would spread into 2x2 blocks. The 1s in row 7 would spread into a 2x2 block. \n\nTesting this hypothesis on Example 1: input row 7 has 2,2,2,2,2. If each 2 spreads right and down, the output row 7 would have more 2s to the right and below. But in the output, row 7 has 2,2,2,2,2 followed by 8s. So this doesn't fit. Unless there's an interaction between numbers. For example, when different numbers are adjacent, they create new numbers. But this complicates things.\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by taking each non-zero cell and adding the same number to the cell to the right and below, then the cell diagonally right-below. So a single cell becomes a 2x2 block. Then, in the next iteration, those blocks also spread. But looking at Example 0's row 10 input [7,7,4], the output becomes [7,7,4,4,0...]. So the 7s spread to the right, and the 4 spreads to the right. So maybe each cell duplicates to the right once. Then, for the next row, each cell duplicates below. So for each non-zero cell, the output has the cell and the cell to the right and below.\n\nBut then, in Example 0's row 10, the 7,7,4 would become 7,7,7,7,4,4. But the output shows 7,7,4,4. Hmm. Alternatively, each number is mirrored to the right and down once. So each cell generates a copy to the right and a copy below. Then, overlapping copies would combine.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to take each non-zero cell and create a copy to the right, down, and right-down, forming a 2x2 block. So the original cell and three new cells. But in Example 0's row 10, the input has two 7s and a 4. The output row 10 would have 7,7,7,4,4. But the actual output is [7,7,4,4]. So maybe the spreading is only to the right and down, but not diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to expand each number into a 3x3 square centered on the original cell, but that would create more cells. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: let's count the number of non-zero cells in input and output. For Example 0, the input has several non-zero cells, and the output has more. So the rule is additive.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input row 9 has [2,1], and the output row 9 has [2,2,1,1]. So each number is duplicated to the right. Similarly, row 10 input has [7,7,4], output [7,7,4,4]. So this suggests that each number is duplicated to the right. Then, looking down the rows, maybe each number is also duplicated below. For example, row 9's 2 and 1 are duplicated to the right, and row 10's 7 and 4 are also duplicated to the right. Then, the output's row 10 would have the original and the duplicates. \n\nBut how does this explain other rows? For example, in Example 0's input row 11 has [3,4]. The output row 11 has [3,3,4,4]. So again, duplicated to the right. Then, perhaps the rule is: for each non-zero cell, duplicate its value to the cell to the right. So each row in the output is the input row with each non-zero number duplicated to the right. But how does that explain the vertical spreading?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 7: [2,2,2,2,2]. The output row 7 has [2,2,2,2,2] followed by 8s. So if the rule is to duplicate to the right, the 2s would become 2,2,2,2,2,2, but the output shows 2,2,2,2,2 followed by 8s. So that's not matching. Therefore, there must be another aspect to the rule.\n\nMaybe the duplication is to the right and down. So each non-zero cell duplicates to the right and down. So for each cell (i,j) in the input with value v, output cell (i,j) is v, (i,j+1) is v, (i+1,j) is v, and (i+1,j+1) is v. This way, each cell creates a 2x2 block. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's input row 9: [0,...,2,1,0...]. Duplicating right would make row 9's output [...,2,2,1,1,...]. Duplicating down would affect row 10. But in the output, row 10 has [7,7,4,4], which could be from the input's row 10 [7,7,4] duplicated right. So this suggests that each row is processed by duplicating to the right, and each column by duplicating down. But how do they interact?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to take each cell and, if non-zero, set the cell to the right and the cell below to the same value. So for cell (i,j), set (i,j+1) and (i+1,j) to the same value. But if there are overlapping cells, they might overwrite each other. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's row 9, the 2 and 1 would set the cells to their right (2\u21922,2; 1\u21921,0). Then, the cells below (row 10, same columns) would also get 2 and 1. But in the input's row 10, there are already 7s and 4s. So this would mix values. Not sure.\n\nThis approach isn't clearly matching the examples. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is a combination of the input and its mirror image. For instance, mirroring each row and combining. But in Example 0's row 10, the input is [...,7,7,4], and the output is [...,7,7,4,4]. Which could be the original plus mirrored to the right. So each row is the original plus its reverse, but only for the non-zero parts.\n\nAlternatively, each row is the original followed by a copy of itself shifted right. But this also doesn't explain all cases.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by applying a right shift to the input and combining. For example, each number is shifted right by one and added to the original. So the output is the original plus the shifted version. For Example 0's row 10, input is [7,7,4], shifted right becomes [0,7,7,4], so the sum would be [7,14, 11,4], but the output is [7,7,4,4], which doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that each number in the input is followed by itself in the output. So each non-zero cell is duplicated to the right. So for each cell (i,j), if it's non-zero, then cell (i,j+1) is also set to the same value. So Example 0's row 10 becomes [7,7,4,4]. Then, the 7s and 4s are duplicated to the right. But how does this explain the vertical changes?\n\nIn Example 1's input row 9 has [0,0,0,0,4,3], which becomes [0,0,0,0,4,4,3,3]. So duplicated to the right. Then, row 10 in the output has [4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3], which would be the result of the 4s and 3s from row 9 being duplicated down. So maybe after duplicating to the right, each number is also duplicated down. So the process is: first duplicate right, then duplicate down. Or vice versa.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\n1. For each cell in the input, if it's non-zero, set the cell to the right to the same value.\n2. Then, for each cell in the modified grid, if it's non-zero, set the cell below to the same value.\n\nThis would result in each non-zero cell spreading to the right and down. For example, a single 7 in the input would become a 2x2 block of 7s in the output. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's row 10 input has [7,7,4]. After step 1, it becomes [7,7,7,4,4]. Then after step 2, each of these would spread down. So row 10 and 11 would have 7,7,7,4,4. But in the output, row 10 is [7,7,4,4], which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the order is reversed: first duplicate down, then right. Let's see. Original cell duplicates down, then the new cell duplicates right. For Example 0's row 10 input [7,7,4], after duplicating down, row 10 and 11 have [7,7,4] each. Then duplicating right, they become [7,7,7,4,4] each. But the output's row 10 is [7,7,4,4], which doesn't match. Maybe the duplication is only once to the right and once down.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that each non-zero cell spreads to the right and down, but not both. So each cell becomes a 2x2 block. For Example 0's row 10 input [7,7,4], the output would have:\n\n7 7 4\n7 7 4\nBut that's not what's in the example. The actual output row 10 is [7,7,4,4], which is just spreading to the right. So maybe only right duplication.\n\nBut then, how to explain vertical spreading in other examples. For instance, Example 1's input row 7 has 2s which spread to the right and down. The output row 7 has more 2s and 8s. So maybe different numbers have different spread directions. 2 spreads right, 8 spreads up, etc.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a different approach. Perhaps the output is the input with each number replaced by its value in binary, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by rotating the input grid and adding it to the original. For example, rotate 90 degrees and overlay. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the 8 in row 8, column 8 is surrounded by 2s. The output has 8s in row 7,8,9 and columns around. So maybe the 8 is expanding in a plus shape. For example, each non-zero cell adds its value to the cells above, below, left, and right. So a cross shape. Then, in the output, each number is surrounded by copies of itself in the four directions. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's input row 7: 2,2,2,2,2. Applying a cross spread would create 2s in the cells around each 2. But the output row 7 has 2,2,2,2,2 with 8s around. So this doesn't fit. Alternatively, each number n expands in a cross shape but is replaced by another number. For example, 2 expands to 8s. But that doesn't explain why 2 would become 8.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let me try to think of another angle. Perhaps the output is the result of applying a single rule to each cell based on its neighbors. For example, if a cell has a neighbor to the left, it copies that value. But the examples don't show this.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are layers, and the output shows all layers combined. For example, each number represents a different layer, and they are combined in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being sorted or ordered in some way. For example, each row is sorted in ascending or descending order. But in Example 0's row 10 input is [7,7,4], output is [7,7,4,4]. Sorting wouldn't do that.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output row 9: [2,2,1,1]. The input row 9 has [2,1]. So it's like each number is duplicated. So the rule could be to double each number in the row, inserting a copy next to it. For example, [2,1] becomes [2,2,1,1]. Then, in the output, each number is doubled. Similarly, row 10's [7,7,4] becomes [7,7,4,4]. This fits. Then, looking at Example 1's input row 9: [4,3] becomes [4,4,3,3] in the output. Yes. Example 2's input row 9 has [2,2,2,2], output row 9 has [2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4]. Wait, but that's more than doubling. Hmm. Wait, Example 2's input row 9 is [2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0], output row 9 is [0,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,0...]. So perhaps after doubling, there's another step. For example, after doubling, each 2 is replaced with 2 and 4. Not sure.\n\nWait, Example 2's input row 10 is [0,0,0,2,0,0...], output row 10 is [0,0,0,2,0,0,4,0...]. So the 2 is duplicated and followed by a 4. So maybe the rule is: each number n is replaced by n and n*2. But 2*2 is 4, which fits. Then, 4 would become 4 and 8. But in Example 1's input row 9, the 4 and 3 become 4,4,3,3. Which would fit doubling but not multiplication. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, each number is followed by its increment. 2 becomes 2,3, but that doesn't fit.\n\nBack to the duplication idea. If the main rule is that each number is duplicated to the right, then the output rows are the input rows with each number appearing twice. But how to explain vertical changes? Like in Example 0's output, there are new numbers in lower rows. Maybe after duplicating right, the same is done for columns, duplicating each number down. So each cell is duplicated right and down, creating a 2x2 block. For example, a single cell becomes four cells. But this would require that the output grid is double the size of the input, but the examples show the same grid size. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the duplication is within the same grid. For example, each number is duplicated to the right and down, but overlapping with existing numbers. This could explain the spread. For example, a 2 in (i,j) duplicates to (i,j+1) and (i+1,j). Then, those duplicates might also duplicate further. But this would require multiple passes, which the examples don't show. The outputs seem to be a single transformation step.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I'll hypothesize that the pattern is to duplicate each non-zero cell to the right. So each number is followed by a copy of itself in the same row. Then, for any cell that was duplicated from the left, also duplicate it down to the row below. But I'm not sure. \n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,2,0...]. If we duplicate each non-zero to the right, it becomes 8,8,8,8,2,2. Then, duplicate down. So row 7 would have 8,8,2,2. But the test input's row 7 has 0,0,0,4,3,0..., so maybe the 8s and 2 are duplicated down as well. But the output would need to reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, each number in the input is duplicated to the right and down, creating a 2x2 block. So the output for the test input's 8 in row 3 would have 8 in (3,5) and (4,5), and (3,6), (4,6). But this might not fit the examples.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the examples, I think the most consistent pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input is duplicated to the right in the output. So each number is followed by a copy of itself in the same row. This fits Example 0, 1, and 2's horizontal spreads. For vertical spreads, perhaps after duplicating to the right, the same is done for columns, but the examples don't clearly show vertical duplication. Alternatively, the vertical spreading is due to numbers being duplicated down in a separate step.\n\nBut given that the test input has numbers in various positions, the output should have each of those numbers duplicated to the right. For example, the 8s in row 3, 4, and 5 would become pairs of 8s. The 2 in row 6 would become 2,2, and the 3 in row 7 would become 3,3. The 1s in row 7 would become 1,1. The 8 in row 7 would become 8,8, and so on.\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input:\n\nTest input row 3: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0...] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0...]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8...] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8...]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8...] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,8...]\n\nRow 6: [...8,8,2,0...] \u2192 [...8,8,8,8,2,2...]\n\nRow 7: [...4,3...] \u2192 [...4,4,3,3...]\n\nRow 17: [0,...,1,0...] \u2192 [0,...,1,1...]\n\nRow 18: [0,...,2,4...] \u2192 [0,...,2,2,4,4...]\n\nRow 19: [0,...,2,2,2...] \u2192 [0,...,2,2,2,2...]\n\nRow 20: [0,...,2,0...] \u2192 [0,...,2,2...]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example 2's output, there's more than just right duplication. For instance, the 6 in row 4 of Example 2's input leads to 6 in row 4 and 5, and columns 10 and 11. So maybe after duplicating right, they also duplicate down.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: duplicate each non-zero cell to the right and down, creating a 2x2 block. So each cell (i,j) with value v sets (i,j+1), (i+1,j), and (i+1,j+1) to v. This would create a 2x2 block. Let's check Example 2's input row 4: 6 in column 10. The output has 6 in row 4, columns 10 and 11, and row 5, columns 10 and 11. This fits the 2x2 block.\n\nSimilarly, Example 1's input row 9: 4 and 3. The output row 9 has 4,4,3,3 and row 10 has 4,4,3,3. So this also fits the 2x2 block. \n\nIf this is the case, then each non-zero cell in the input creates a 2x2 block in the output, potentially overlapping with other blocks. This would explain the spreading in all examples.\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input:\n\nFor each non-zero cell, create a 2x2 block to the right and down.\n\nLet's take the test input's row 3, column 5: 8. This would set (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6) to 8. Similarly, row 4's 8s in columns 4,5,6 would each create their own blocks. This would result in a larger 8 structure.\n\nThe 2 in row 6, column 17 would create a block around there. The 3 in row 7, column 18 would create a block there. The 1s in row 7, columns 15-17 would create blocks. The 4 in row 18, column 13 would create a block. And so on.\n\nThus, the test output would have these 2x2 blocks wherever there are non-zero cells in the input. Let's try to construct it.\n\nFor example, the 8s in row 3, 4, 5:\n\nRow 3, column 5: 8 \u2192 (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6) \u2192 8s.\n\nRow 4 has 8s in columns 4,5,6. Each of these would spread to the right and down, creating blocks. So row 4's 8s would create 8s in rows 4 and 5, columns 4-7.\n\nRow 5's 8 in column 5 and 7 would create blocks there.\n\nThe 2 in row 6, column 17 \u2192 creates 2s in (6,17), (6,18), (7,17), (7,18).\n\nThe 3 in row 7, column 18 \u2192 creates 3s in (7,18), (7,19), (8,18), (8,19).\n\nThe 1s in row 7, columns 15-17 \u2192 each 1 creates a block. So 1s would be in (7,15), (7,16), (8,15), (8,16) for column 15's 1, and similarly for others.\n\nRow 17's 1 in column 13 \u2192 creates 1s in (17,13), (17,14), (18,13), (18,14).\n\nRow 18's 2 and 4 in columns 13 and 14 \u2192 creates 2s and 4s in their blocks.\n\nRow 19's 2s in columns 11-13 \u2192 create blocks for each 2.\n\nRow 20's 2 in column 11 \u2192 creates a block.\n\nPutting this together, the output would have expanded blocks around each non-zero input cell. This matches the patterns seen in the training examples.",
