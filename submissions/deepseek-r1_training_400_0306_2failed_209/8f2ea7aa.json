        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples given.\n\nFirst, Example 0. The input has some 8s in the first three rows. The output seems to have more 8s arranged in a certain pattern. Let me visualize the input and output grids.\n\nIn the input of Example 0:\n- First row: [8,8,0,...]\n- Second row: [0,0,8,...]\n- Third row: [8,0,0,...]\n\nThe output has 8s spread out more. For instance, the first row in the output becomes [8,8,0,8,8,0,...]. Hmm, maybe the 8s are being mirrored or copied in some way. Also, looking at the lower rows in the output, there are 8s appearing towards the bottom. Maybe the original positions are being shifted or transformed in a specific direction.\n\nExample 1's input has 7s in a sort of diagonal arrangement in the middle. The output then spreads those 7s in a pattern that looks like they're moving diagonally upwards and maybe reflecting. For instance, the input has a 7 in row 3, column 5 (0-based?), and the output starts having 7s appearing in the top right. Like, the first row's last element is 7, and the second row's last two are 7s. So maybe each original number is being moved or copied in a certain direction, perhaps diagonally.\n\nExample 2's input has a triangle of 6s in the top rows, and the output shows those 6s being replicated in a more complex pattern, maybe rotated or expanded. The output rows 3,4,5 have 6s forming another triangle-like shape, and then rows 6,7,8 have another set. It looks like the original 6s are being tiled or rotated in some way.\n\nLooking for a common pattern across all examples. Maybe each number is being shifted in a certain direction and then mirrored or copied. For example, in Example 0, the 8s in the first row might be shifted to the right and down, creating a sort of diagonal spread. Alternatively, it could be that each original position is generating a 3x3 pattern around it, but scaled or rotated.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the input represents a starting point, and the output is generating a larger pattern by tiling or rotating the original elements. For instance, each non-zero element in the input is being expanded into a certain shape in the output. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the original 8s are in the top three rows. The output seems to have those 8s forming a kind of arrowhead pattern. Like, each original 8 might be generating a small pattern around it. Or maybe the entire grid is being transformed through a rotation or reflection.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output. The input has 8s in positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,0). The output has 8s in more positions, but arranged in a way that might be a mirror image or rotated. For instance, row 0 in output has 8s at 0,1,3,4. Maybe each original 8 is creating a copy to the right and down. But not sure yet.\n\nAnother idea: the output could be the input array convolved with a certain kernel. For example, each non-zero element is creating a specific pattern in the output. For instance, in Example 1, the 7s in the input are arranged in a diagonal, and the output has 7s spreading out in a diagonal direction. The output for Example 1 looks like a diamond shape expanding upwards. So maybe each non-zero element is being spread out in a certain way, like each 7 in the input creates a vertical line or diagonal in the output.\n\nAlternatively, considering the output grids are the same size as the input (9x9), perhaps the transformation involves rotating parts of the grid. For example, the input is split into blocks and each block is rotated or transformed. Looking at Example 2's input and output: the input has a small triangle of 6s in the top. The output has that triangle repeated in other quadrants, maybe. For example, rows 3-5 and 6-8 in the output have similar 6 patterns. So maybe the grid is divided into 3x3 blocks and each block is transformed based on the original input.\n\nWait, each example's input has non-zero numbers in a certain area, and the output seems to spread those numbers into a larger area. For instance, in Example 0, the input's 8s are in the top three rows, and the output's 8s are spread throughout the grid, forming a sort of fractal-like pattern. Similarly, Example 1's 7s spread into a diamond shape. Example 2's 6s form a more complex pattern with multiple triangles.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe each non-zero element is being used to generate a certain shape in the output. For example, an 8 in the input could generate a 3x3 block of 8s in a certain configuration. But looking at Example 0's first input row: [8,8,0,...], and the output's first row is [8,8,0,8,8,0,...]. So the original two 8s are followed by two more 8s after two zeros. Maybe it's a matter of duplicating the original elements with some offset. Like, the original 8s are mirrored in some way. For example, the first row in the input has 8s at positions 0 and 1. In the output, they are at 0,1,3,4. That's a duplication after two zeros. So maybe the pattern is to take each non-zero element and copy it two positions to the right, then combine with the original. But then why in Example 1, the 7s in the input (which are in the lower middle) end up in the top right. So perhaps there's a rotation involved.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions. For Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal 8s are in:\n\nRow 0: columns 0 and 1.\n\nRow 1: column 2.\n\nRow 2: column 0.\n\nIn the output, the first three rows have 8s in:\n\nRow 0: 0,1,3,4.\n\nRow 1: 2,5.\n\nRow 2:0,3.\n\nThen in rows 3-5, there are 8s appearing in columns 6 and 7, etc. Maybe the original 8s are being duplicated in a way that shifts them three positions to the right and three down. For instance, row 0's 8s are copied to row 3, column 3 and 4? Let me check. Output row 3 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0]. So columns 6 and 7. Hmm. Maybe it's a combination of shifting and reflecting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grid is divided into sections. For example, a 3x3 grid where each cell is a 3x3 block. So the original 9x9 grid is divided into 3x3 blocks. Each block in the input is transformed into a larger pattern. For instance, if the input's top-left 3x3 block has 8s, then the output's corresponding 3x3 blocks are arranged in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the non-zero elements are in the first three rows (rows 0,1,2), which could correspond to the top 3x3 block. The output's 8s are spread across the entire grid. For instance, the first three rows in the output have 8s in their own 3x3 blocks. Wait, maybe each 3x3 block in the input is expanded into a 3x3 pattern in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is treated as a 3x3 grid, where each element is a 3x3 block. For example, each number in the input's 3x3 grid is placed into the corresponding 3x3 block in the output. But the examples have 9x9 grids, which would make sense if each original 3x3 is scaled up to 9x9. Wait, that's possible. Let's check Example 2. The input has 6s in rows 0,1,2 (columns 4, 3-5, etc.), and the output has those 6s spread into more blocks. For example, the input's first few rows form a small triangle of 6s, and the output's 6s form a larger pattern. If each 3x3 block in the input is mapped to a 3x3 block in the output in a tiling fashion, then maybe each non-zero element in the input's cell (i,j) is replicated into a certain pattern in the output's corresponding 3x3 block at (3i, 3j), etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. But looking at Example 0's input and output: the input's 8s are in the top left, but the output's 8s are in more positions, including lower rows, which might not fit a simple rotation.\n\nWait, let's look for symmetry. In Example 0's output, rows 0-2 have 8s that might mirror rows 6-8. For instance, row 0 and row 6 in the output both start with 8,8. Row 1 and row 7 have 8s in similar positions. So maybe the output is a combination of the original input and its rotated or mirrored versions. Like, the original pattern is placed in the top-left, then mirrored in the bottom-left, and perhaps other quadrants.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input matrix after being rotated 180 degrees and combined with the original. But that doesn't seem to fit exactly.\n\nAnother idea: the pattern involves creating a larger structure by tiling the original input's non-zero elements in a diamond or cross shape. For example, each non-zero element is the center, and surrounding elements are filled in a certain way. But in Example 1's output, the 7s form a diamond pattern expanding upwards. The input's 7s are arranged in a diagonal line, and the output's 7s form a diamond, which could be created by moving each 7 in the input upwards and spreading out.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero element is moved up by (n) rows and right by (n) columns, where n is the row index in the input. For example, in Example 1's input, the 7 in row 3, column 5 (assuming rows and columns are 0-based) would move up by 3 rows and right by 3 columns, ending up in row 0, column 8. Which matches the first row's last element being 7. Then the 7 in row 4, columns 4 and 5 would move up 4 rows and right 4 columns. But row 4 -4 = 0, column 4+4=8. So in row 0, column 8. But that's already filled. Hmm, maybe that's part of the pattern, but perhaps there's a different shift.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero element in row i, column j is moved to row (i - k), column (j + k) for some k. For example, in Example 1's input, the 7s are in rows 3,4,5. Let's see:\n\nRow 3, column 5: moving up 3 rows (to row 0) and right 3 columns (to 8), which matches the output's row 0, column 8 (7). The 7 in row 4, column 4: moving up 4 rows (row 0) and right 4 columns (column 8), but column 4+4=8. So row 0, column 8. But in the output, row 4's original 7s are transformed into positions in row 0 and others. Wait, maybe each 7 is moved up by its row index and right by its column index. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for each non-zero element in the input and see where they end up in the output.\n\nTake Example 1:\n\nInput has:\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIn the output, the first occurrence of 7 is in row 0, column 8 (last element). Then row 1, columns 7 and 8. Row 2, column 6. Row 3, column 5 and 8. Row 4, columns 4,5,7,8. Row5, columns 3 and 6. Row6, column2. Row7, columns 0 and 1. Row8, column0.\n\nSo, each original 7 in the input seems to generate a line of 7s moving up and to the right. For example, the 7 in row3, column5 (input) becomes part of a diagonal line from row0, column8 (output) down to row3, column5, and further. Similarly, the 7s in row4, columns4 and 5 in the input might create their own diagonal lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element is being \"projected\" upwards along a diagonal. For example, the 7 in row3, column5 of the input is moved up to row0, column8 (since 3+5=8, perhaps? 3+5=8, which is the column index in the output's row0). Then, the 7 in row4, column4 (4+4=8) would end up in row0, column8. But in the output, row0, column8 is 7, which could be the sum of multiple projections. Similarly, the 7 in row4, column5 (4+5=9, which is beyond 8) might wrap around? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor the 7 in row3, column5 (input):\n\nIf moving up by 3 rows and right by 3 columns, we get to row0, column8 (since 5+3=8). That's exactly where the first 7 is in the output. Similarly, the 7 in row4, column4: moving up 4 rows (to row0) and right 4 columns (to column8). But column4+4=8. So row0, column8 again. But that's already occupied. How does that explain the other 7s in the output? Maybe each 7 is generating multiple positions based on different shifts.\n\nAlternatively, the displacement could be based on the original position's coordinates. For example, a 7 at (i,j) is placed at (i - k, j + k) for k from 0 to i. So for row3, column5, k could be 3, leading to (0, 8). For k=2: (1,7). For k=1: (2,6). For k=0: (3,5). This would explain why in the output, row0, column8; row1, column7; row2, column6; row3, column5 all have 7s. But looking at the output for Example1, the original positions (row3,5; row4,4-5; row5,3) are also present in the output. So maybe each 7 is copied along a diagonal line upwards to the right, starting from the original position.\n\nYes! This seems promising. Let's check:\n\nOriginal 7 in row3, column5:\n\n- For k=0: (3,5) \u2192 output row3, column5: yes, the output's row3 has a 7 at column5.\n\n- k=1: (2,6) \u2192 output row2, column6: yes, output row2 has 7 at column6.\n\n- k=2: (1,7) \u2192 output row1, column7: yes.\n\n- k=3: (0,8) \u2192 output row0, column8: yes.\n\nSimilarly, the 7 in row4, column4:\n\n- k=0: (4,4) \u2192 output row4, column4: yes, there's a 7.\n\n- k=1: (3,5) \u2192 output row3, column5: already a 7 (from the original row3,5).\n\n- k=2: (2,6) \u2192 output row2, column6: yes.\n\n- k=3: (1,7) \u2192 output row1, column7: yes.\n\n- k=4: (0,8) \u2192 output row0, column8: already filled.\n\nBut in the output, row4, column4 is 7, and row4, column5 is 7 (from the input's row4,5). So perhaps each 7 in the input is being copied along the diagonal up-right direction, starting at their original position and moving up as far as possible, adding a 7 at each step. But how do overlapping positions handle multiple 7s? They just remain 7.\n\nThis seems to fit Example1's output. Let's check another position. Input's row5, column3 (7):\n\n- k=0: (5,3) \u2192 output row5, column3: yes, 7.\n\n- k=1: (4,4) \u2192 output row4, column4: yes.\n\n- k=2: (3,5) \u2192 output row3, column5: yes.\n\n- k=3: (2,6) \u2192 output row2, column6: yes.\n\n- k=4: (1,7) \u2192 output row1, column7: yes.\n\n- k=5: (0,8) \u2192 output row0, column8: yes.\n\nSo all these positions in the output have 7s. And indeed, looking at Example1's output, those positions do have 7s. So the pattern seems to be that each non-zero number in the input is propagated diagonally upwards to the right, filling all cells along the path from their original position to the top-right corner.\n\nApplying this logic to Example0. Let's take the 8 at row0, column0:\n\n- k=0: (0,0) \u2192 8 remains.\n\n- But since it's already at row0, it can't move up further. So only (0,0) remains.\n\nWait, but in Example0's output, row0 has 8s at 0,1,3,4. That doesn't fit this pattern. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the movement is in a different direction. Let's re-examine Example0's input and output.\n\nIn Example0's input, the 8s are at positions:\n\nRow0: 0,1.\n\nRow1:2.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nIn the output, the 8s appear in:\n\nRow0:0,1,3,4.\n\nRow1:2,5.\n\nRow2:0,3.\n\nRows3:6,7.\n\nRows4:8.\n\nRows5:6.\n\nRows6:0,1.\n\nRow7:2.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nHmm. This is more complex. Maybe the movement is not just diagonal. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the 8 in row0, column0 (input):\n\nIn the output, there's an 8 at row0,0; row0,3; row3,6; row6,0. Wait, maybe the 8s are being spread in a pattern where each is moved three columns to the right and three rows down. For example, row0,0 \u2192 row3,3 \u2192 row6,6. But in the output, row3,6 and row6,0. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the movement could be that each 8 is copied to the right by (original row index) columns and down by (original column index) rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a combination of the original input and its transpose, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example0's first row: [8,8,0,8,8,0,...]. The first two 8s are the same as input. Then two more 8s after two zeros. This looks like a repetition of the original pair with an offset. Similarly, in row1, the original 8 is at column2, and in output, another 8 at column5. So, three columns apart. So perhaps each non-zero element is copied with a shift of three columns. So in row0, the 8s are copied from columns 0,1 to 3,4 (adding 3). Similarly, in row1, the 8 at column2 is copied to column5 (2+3=5). Then in row3, the 8s are at 6,7 (3+3=6). But how does this fit with the rows? For example, row0's copies are in the same row. But row1's copies are in row1 as well. Then, perhaps the 8s are also copied three rows down. For example, the 8s in row0, columns0-1 are copied to row3, columns3-4, and row6, columns6-7. But in the output, row3 has 8s at columns6-7, which is 6=3*2, but not exactly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the grid is divided into three vertical and horizontal sections. Each 3x3 section. For example, the input's top-left 3x3 (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) has 8s. The output's top-left, middle-left, and bottom-left 3x3 sections each have 8s arranged in a pattern. For example, the original 8s are replicated in each third of the grid. So row0 in input is copied to row0, row3, row6 in output. But in Example0's output, row6 has 8s in columns0,1, which matches the input's row0. So maybe each original row is copied to the same position in each third of the output grid. Like, the input's row0 is copied to output rows0,3,6. Similarly, row1 to rows1,4,7, and row2 to rows2,5,8. Then columns are replicated in the same way. So each column in the input is copied to columns0,3,6 in the output. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example0's input row0: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nIf this row is copied to rows0,3,6 in the output, and columns0-2 are copied to columns0-2,3-5,6-8, then each 8 would appear in columns0,1,3,4,6,7. But in the output's row0, the 8s are at 0,1,3,4. So maybe it's only copied twice? Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row0: [8,8,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]. So the original 8s are in columns0 and1, and then again in columns3 and4. Columns3-4 are columns0-1 plus 3. So maybe each element is copied with an offset of 3 columns. Similarly, in row3 of the output, the 8s are at columns6 and7 (3+3=6). So columns0+3*2=6. And rows 0,3,6. So the original rows are multiplied by 3. For example, input row0 \u2192 output rows0,3,6. Input row1 \u2192 output rows1,4,7. Input row2 \u2192 output rows2,5,8. Similarly for columns. So each element in input (i,j) is placed in output (i*3, j*3). But then, in Example0's input row0, column0 and1: 8s. So output would have 8s at (0,0), (0,3), (0,6), (3,0), (3,3), etc. But in the output, row0 has 8s at 0,1,3,4. So perhaps this is not the case. Maybe the elements are replicated in 3x3 blocks. For example, each input cell (i,j) corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output starting at (3i,3j). So input's cell (0,0) would become a 3x3 block in output's (0,0). If the input's (0,0) is 8, then the output's (0,0) block is filled with 8s in some pattern. Looking at Example0's output, row0, columns0-1 are 8s. Maybe each input cell is replicated in a 2x2 block in the output, but that doesn't fit 9x9 grid. Alternatively, each input cell is spread to a 3x3 block where the center is the original value, and surrounding cells are filled in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by tiling the input three times in each direction. But in Example0's input is 9x9, which would not need tiling. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Each non-zero element in the input is generating a cross or some shape in the output. For example, in Example1, each 7 generates a diagonal line upwards. In Example0, each 8 generates a horizontal pair and a vertical pair.\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the 8s in the first few rows form a pattern where each original 8 is followed by another 8 three columns to the right. For example, row0's 8s at 0,1 and then 3,4. So that's a duplication three columns apart. Similarly, row1's 8 at 2 is duplicated at 5. Then in row3, the 8s are at 6 and7, which is three columns from 3 and4. So perhaps each non-zero element is copied three columns to the right and three rows down. For example, the original 8 at (0,0) is copied to (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3). But in the output, (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3) are all 8s. Let's check:\n\nOriginal 8s in input:\n\n(0,0) \u2192 copies to (0+0,0+0) (original), (0+0,0+3), (0+3,0+0), (0+3,0+3). So (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3). But in the output's row0, columns0 and3 are 8s, but row3, column0 is not. Instead, in output row3, the 8s are at columns6 and7. Hmm. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero element is mirrored both horizontally and vertically. For example, the original position (i,j) is mirrored to (i, 8-j) and (8-i, j), and (8-i,8-j). But looking at Example0's input (0,0) would mirror to (0,8), (8,0), (8,8). But in the output, there's an 8 at (6,0) in row6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves rotating the original positions by 180 degrees. For example, the original 8s in the top are mirrored to the bottom. For instance, input's (0,0) becomes (8,8) in the output. But in Example0's output, (8,8) is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the test input:\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (row3)\n[2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (row4)\n[0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] (row5)\n\nSo the non-zero elements are in rows3-5, columns0-2. The pattern from the training examples would need to be applied here. Let's suppose that the pattern is to move each non-zero element diagonally up-right, as in Example1. So each 2 in row3, column0 would move up 3 rows and right 3 columns, to row0, column3. Then row4, columns0 and1 would move up 4 and right 0 and1, but that would go to negative rows. Alternatively, maybe each 2 in rowi, columnj is moved up by i rows and right by j columns. But rowi - i would be 0, and columnj + j. For example, the 2 in row3, column0 would go to row0, column0+0=0. So (0,0). The 2 in row4, column0 would go to row0 (4-4=0), column0+0=0. Similarly, row4, column1: row0, column1+4=5. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is rowi -k and columnj +k for each possible k. So for each 2, generate a series of positions by subtracting k from the row and adding k to the column for k=0 to i.\n\nFor example, the 2 in row3, column0:\n\nk=0: (3,0) \u2192 remains in output.\n\nk=1: (2,1)\n\nk=2: (1,2)\n\nk=3: (0,3)\n\nSo output would have 2s at (3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,3).\n\nSimilarly, the 2 in row4, column0:\n\nk=0: (4,0)\n\nk=1: (3,1)\n\nk=2: (2,2)\n\nk=3: (1,3)\n\nk=4: (0,4)\n\nAnd the 2 in row4, column1:\n\nk=0: (4,1)\n\nk=1: (3,2)\n\nk=2: (2,3)\n\nk=3: (1,4)\n\nk=4: (0,5)\n\nThe 2s in row5, column1 and2:\n\nFor row5, column1:\n\nk=0: (5,1)\n\nk=1: (4,2)\n\nk=2: (3,3)\n\nk=3: (2,4)\n\nk=4: (1,5)\n\nk=5: (0,6)\n\nFor row5, column2:\n\nk=0: (5,2)\n\nk=1: (4,3)\n\nk=2: (3,4)\n\nk=3: (2,5)\n\nk=4: (1,6)\n\nk=5: (0,7)\n\nIf this is the case, then the output would have 2s along these diagonals. Let's see what the expected output might look like.\n\nFor example, the test input's rows3-5 have 2s. Applying this pattern:\n\nThe 2 in row3,0 would generate:\n\n(3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,3).\n\nThe 2 in row4,0:\n\n(4,0), (3,1), (2,2), (1,3), (0,4).\n\nThe 2 in row4,1:\n\n(4,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,4), (0,5).\n\nThe 2 in row5,1:\n\n(5,1), (4,2), (3,3), (2,4), (1,5), (0,6).\n\nThe 2 in row5,2:\n\n(5,2), (4,3), (3,4), (2,5), (1,6), (0,7).\n\nAdditionally, the 2 in row5,2 would also generate these positions.\n\nNow, let's see how this would translate to the output grid. For instance:\n\nRow0 would have 2s at columns3,4,5,6,7.\n\nRow1: columns2,3,4,5,6.\n\nRow2: columns1,2,3,4,5.\n\nRow3: columns0,1,2,3,4.\n\nRow4: columns0,1,2,3.\n\nRow5: columns1,2.\n\nPlus the original positions.\n\nBut this is getting complicated, but it's possible. Looking at the training example outputs, they have non-zero elements spreading upwards in diagonal lines, so this aligns with the idea.\n\nTherefore, the pattern seems to be that each non-zero element in the input is propagated along the diagonal towards the top-right, starting from its original position and moving up one row and right one column for each step until reaching the top row.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's process each 2 in the input:\n\nInput rows3-5:\n\nRow3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 (3,0) is a 2.\n\nRow4: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 (4,0) and (4,1) are 2s.\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 (5,1) and (5,2) are 2s.\n\nFor each of these positions, generate the diagonal upwards-right.\n\nFor (3,0):\n\nSteps: k=0 to3.\n\n(3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,3).\n\nFor (4,0):\n\nSteps: k=0 to4.\n\n(4,0), (3,1), (2,2), (1,3), (0,4).\n\nFor (4,1):\n\nSteps: k=0 to4.\n\n(4,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,4), (0,5).\n\nFor (5,1):\n\nSteps: k=0 to5.\n\n(5,1), (4,2), (3,3), (2,4), (1,5), (0,6).\n\nFor (5,2):\n\nSteps: k=0 to5.\n\n(5,2), (4,3), (3,4), (2,5), (1,6), (0,7).\n\nNow, each of these positions in the output grid will have a 2.\n\nSo let's construct the output:\n\nInitialize all rows as [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThen fill in the generated positions.\n\nFor (3,0) series:\n\nRow3,0 \u2192 2.\n\nRow2,1 \u2192 2.\n\nRow1,2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow0,3 \u2192 2.\n\nFor (4,0):\n\nRow4,0 \u2192 2.\n\nRow3,1 \u2192 2.\n\nRow2,2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow1,3 \u2192 2.\n\nRow0,4 \u2192 2.\n\nFor (4,1):\n\nRow4,1 \u2192 2.\n\nRow3,2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow2,3 \u2192 2.\n\nRow1,4 \u2192 2.\n\nRow0,5 \u2192 2.\n\nFor (5,1):\n\nRow5,1 \u2192 2.\n\nRow4,2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow3,3 \u2192 2.\n\nRow2,4 \u2192 2.\n\nRow1,5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow0,6 \u2192 2.\n\nFor (5,2):\n\nRow5,2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow4,3 \u2192 2.\n\nRow3,4 \u2192 2.\n\nRow2,5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow1,6 \u2192 2.\n\nRow0,7 \u2192 2.\n\nNow, let's fill these into the output grid. Note that some positions might be filled by multiple sources, but since they're all 2s, it's fine.\n\nLet's build the output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows6-8: all zeros (since no generated positions here).\n\nBut wait, the input's original rows3-5 have 2s, which are also part of the output. But according to the pattern, those original positions are already included in the generated steps (k=0).\n\nLooking at the test input's row3: [2,0,...] \u2192 (3,0) is 2, which is in the output's row3,0. Similarly for others.\n\nBut let's write out each row with the filled 2s.\n\nRow0:\n\nColumns3,4,5,6,7: 2s.\n\nSo [0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0].\n\nRow1:\n\nColumns2,3,4,5,6: 2s.\n\n[0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0].\n\nRow2:\n\nColumns1,2,3,4,5: 2s.\n\n[0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0].\n\nRow3:\n\nColumns0,1,2,3,4: 2s.\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow4:\n\nColumns0,1,2,3: 2s.\n\n[2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow5:\n\nColumns1,2: 2s.\n\n[0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRows6-8: all zeros.\n\nBut wait, according to the pattern, the original positions are filled. For example, row5, column2 is part of the input and output. So this seems correct.\n\nHowever, comparing this with the training examples, particularly Example1 and Example0, the outputs have non-zero elements in lower rows as well. For example, in Example0's output, there are 8s in row6 and others. But according to our pattern, the test input's output would have 2s only up to row5, and rows6-8 are zeros. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in Example1's input, the 7s are in rows3-5, and the output has 7s in rows0-8. So according to the pattern, the generated positions go all the way to row0, and the lower rows (6-8) also have 7s. Wait, but in the test input, the generated positions for the 2s in rows3-5 would only go up to row0. How does Example1 have 7s in lower rows?\n\nLooking back at Example1's input, the 7s are in rows3,4,5. The output's lower rows (6-8) have 7s as well. For example, row6 has a 7 in column2. How does that happen?\n\nAh, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine Example1's input and the pattern. Example1's input has:\n\nRow3: 7 at column5.\n\nRow4: 7s at columns4 and5.\n\nRow5: 7 at column3.\n\nAccording to the pattern, each 7 is propagated upwards. For example, row3,5's 7 would generate positions (3,5), (2,6), (1,7), (0,8). Those are in the upper rows. But in the output, there are 7s in lower rows like row6, column2. That must be from another source. Oh wait, maybe the pattern also includes propagating downward? Or perhaps the propagation is in both directions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 7s are also propagated downwards. For instance, each non-zero element is copied in both upward and downward directions. But that doesn't fit Example1's output.\n\nWait, in Example1's output, row6, column2 has a 7. Where does that come from? Let's see: input's row5, column3. When k increases beyond the row index, perhaps it wraps around? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the propagation continues beyond the row index. For example, for a 7 in row5, column3, the steps would be:\n\nk=0: (5,3).\n\nk=1: (4,4).\n\nk=2: (3,5).\n\nk=3: (2,6).\n\nk=4: (1,7).\n\nk=5: (0,8).\n\nBut how does row6, column2 get a 7? It doesn't fit this pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the propagation is not limited to moving upwards, but can also move downwards. For example, each non-zero element is copied in both the upward-right and downward-right directions. Let me check Example1's output.\n\nIn Example1's output, row6 has 7s in column2. That's below the original row3,4,5. So perhaps the propagation isn't just upwards. Maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to mirror the original positions in some way. For example, each non-zero element is reflected across the central row or column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: the pattern involves moving each non-zero element to the right by (row index) and down by (row index). For example, a 7 in row3, column5 would move to row3 +3=6, column5+3=8. But in Example1's output, row6, column8 is 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, moving down and to the right by the same amount. For example, row3,5 \u2192 row3+3=6, column5+3=8 (which is 0 in output). No.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's go back to the test input and see what the expected output would look like based on the previous pattern (propagating up-right).\n\nThe test input's output would have 2s in rows0-5, columns0-7. But according to the training examples, the outputs often have elements in the lower rows as well, like in Example0 and Example1. So maybe the pattern isn't just propagating upwards but also downwards.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, there are 8s in row6-8. Let's check their positions. For instance, row6 is [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which matches the input's row0. Similarly, row7 is [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0], matching row1. Row8 is [8,0,0,0,...], matching row2. So it's like the input's rows0-2 are repeated three times, each shifted by 3 rows. So the output is a combination of the original rows and their copies shifted by 3 and 6 rows. And columns are copied similarly. So the output is made by tiling the input's top 3 rows and left 3 columns into a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. For example, each original cell (i,j) in the top 3x3 of the input is placed into the output's blocks at (i*3, j*3), (i*3, j*3+3), etc.\n\nBut how does this fit with Example0's input and output?\n\nExample0's input has non-zero elements in rows0-2. The output has those elements replicated in blocks. For example, row0 of the input has [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which would form the top-left block of the output. Then, replicated to the middle-left and bottom-left blocks. Similarly for other rows. This would create a larger pattern by tiling the input's top 3 rows three times. However, in Example0's output, the 8s are not just in the first three rows but spread throughout. So maybe this is the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input matrix concatenated three times in each direction. For example, input's rows0-2 are repeated three times vertically, and their columns are repeated three times horizontally. But this would result in a larger grid than 9x9. Not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by replacing each non-zero element with a 3x3 block of the same number arranged in a specific pattern. For example, each 8 becomes a 2x2 block of 8s. Let's check Example0's first input row: [8,8,0...]. The output's first row is [8,8,0,8,8,0...]. So after two 8s, two zeros, then two 8s again. This looks like replacing each 8 with two 8s, separated by a zero. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the transformation is a combination of shifting the original elements to the right and down by multiples of 3, and also leaving the original in place. For instance, each non-zero element is copied to positions (i, j), (i, j+3), (i+3, j), (i+3, j+3), (i+6, j), etc., but this depends on the grid size.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input, the 8 at (0,0) would be copied to (0,0), (0,3), (0,6), (3,0), (3,3), (3,6), (6,0), (6,3), (6,6). But in the output, row0 has 8s at 0,1,3,4. So this doesn't fit. Unless the copy is not exact but forms a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero element is replaced with a 3x3 block where the element is in the center and surrounded by zeros. But again, this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nThis is proving to be quite challenging. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that each non-zero element is propagated diagonally upwards to the right, filling all positions from the original to the top-right corner.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe 2s in rows3-5 would generate diagonal lines upwards, leading to 2s in the upper rows as per the steps outlined earlier. The output would have 2s in rows0-5, with the highest concentration in the middle, tapering towards the top-right.\n\nGiven that the training examples have outputs where the non-zero elements form such diagonal patterns, this seems plausible. Therefore, the final output for the test input should have 2s along the diagonals generated by each original 2 in the input.",

The goal is to find out how the input grids are transformed into the output grids and apply that to the test case.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 8s in the first few rows. The output looks like those 8s have been copied or moved in some pattern. Let me look closer. The first row of input is [8,8,0,...], and the output's first row is [8,8,0,8,8,0,...]. Hmm, maybe the original 8s are replicated to the right and down? Like, each 8 is creating a sort of diagonal or expanding in a certain direction.\n\nLooking at the second input row in Example 0: [0,0,8,0,...]. The output row becomes [0,0,8,0,0,8,...]. So the 8 in position 3 (index 2) is now also in position 6 (index 5). Similarly, in the third input row, the 8 in position 0 becomes 8 in position 3 in the output. Maybe there's a shift here. Like each 8 is shifted three positions to the right, but also wrapped around? But the output rows are longer. Wait, the input has 9 elements per row, as does the output. Wait, perhaps each 8 in the input is being replicated in a pattern that's three positions to the right and three rows down?\n\nWait, let's see the positions. For Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 8 at 0 and 1.\nRow 1: 8 at 2.\nRow 2: 8 at 0.\n\nOutput rows:\nRow 0: 8,8,0,8,8,0... So original positions 0 and 1, and then 3 and 4.\nRow 1: 8 at 2 and 5.\nRow 2: 8 at 0 and 3.\nThen, in the output, starting from row 3, there are new 8s. For example, row 3 has 8s at 6 and 7. Row 4 has 8 at 8. Row 5 has 8 at 6. Then rows 6,7,8 mirror the original input again. Wait, the output seems to have the original input rows shifted down by 3 rows and right by 3 columns, then combined with the original.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the original input plus a shifted version. Let's check. For example, in the output of Example 0, the first three rows have 8s in their original positions and shifted three columns to the right. Then the next three rows (rows 3-5) have 8s shifted three columns right and three rows down. Then rows 6-8 are the same as the original input rows 0-2 again. So maybe the output is created by overlaying three copies of the input: original, shifted 3 right and 3 down, and shifted 6 right and 6 down? But since the grid is 9x9, shifting 6 would wrap around. Wait, but in the output of Example 0, row 6 is [8,8,0,...], which is the same as row 0 of the input. So maybe after shifting by 3 rows and 3 columns, the 8s appear again. So perhaps the pattern is that each 8 is copied three positions to the right and three positions down, then again three more if possible. But the grid is 9x9, so shifting three rows down from row 0 would take it to row 3, then row 6. Shifting three columns to the right would take column 0 to 3, then 6. So the 8s are placed in (original row, original col), (row+3 mod 9, col+3 mod9), (row+6 mod9, col+6 mod9). Let's test this.\n\nTake the first input in Example 0: Row 0, columns 0 and 1 have 8s. Then in the output, these would be at (0,0), (3,3), (6,6) for each 8. Wait, but in the output row 0, columns 0 and 1 are 8s, and columns 3 and 4 are 8s. Hmm, maybe I'm not considering the shift correctly. Let's see. Original position (0,0) shifts by 3 rows and 3 columns would be (3,3). Then another shift would be (6,6). So in the output, (0,0) is original, (3,3) is the shifted, and (6,6) is shifted again. Let's check the output of Example 0. The first row of output has 8s at 0,1,3,4. So maybe each 8 is creating a 2x2 block shifted by 3 each time? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each 8 is generating a 2x2 square at their original position, and then another 2x2 square shifted three rows and columns down. Let's see.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the first row has two 8s. The output's first row has four 8s: positions 0,1,3,4. Then the fourth row in the output (row index 3) has 8s at 6 and 7. That's three rows down from row 0. So if the original 8s in row 0, columns 0 and 1 are copied to row 3, columns 3 and 4? Because 0+3=3, 1+3=4. Similarly, in row 3 of the output, 8s are at 6 and 7. Wait, 3+3=6. So column 0+3=3, but in row 3 of output, the 8s are at 6 and 7. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the 8s are moving in a diagonal direction. For example, each 8 is copied three places to the right and three down. So original (0,0) becomes (3,3), (6,6). But the output for Example 0's row 0 has 8s at (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4). Maybe it's expanding in a different way.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is creating a diamond pattern around each original 8. Let's look at Example 1. The input has a 7 in the fourth row (row 3) column 5, then fifth row (row4) columns4 and5, sixth row (row5) column3. The output has a sort of diamond shape. For example, in the output of Example1, the 7s form a diamond shape expanding from the original positions. The original 7s in the input are arranged in a small triangle. The output seems to mirror that pattern but expanded in all directions. For instance, in the output, the 7s are arranged in a larger diamond. So perhaps the transformation involves reflecting or expanding the original pattern in some symmetric way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example2. The input has a 6 in the middle (row0 column4, row1 columns3 and5, row2 columns3 and4). The output adds more 6s in a pattern that seems to mirror or repeat the original pattern in different quadrants. For example, the original 6s are in the upper part, and the output has similar patterns shifted to the right and down.\n\nAnother approach: check if each number is being replicated in a way that forms a larger version of the original shape. For instance, in Example0, the original 8s form a line in the first three rows. The output's 8s are arranged in a larger version of that shape, perhaps scaled by a factor and tiled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell in the output is determined by looking at the input cell and its neighbors. But considering the examples, the output cells are not just immediate neighbors. The patterns are more spread out.\n\nWait, looking at the input and output dimensions. All grids are 9x9. So perhaps the output is generated by tiling the input three times in a 3x3 grid. For example, each original 3x3 section is scaled up. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is a convolution or a kernel operation. For example, each 8 in the input is creating a 3x3 pattern in the output. But looking at Example0's input, the first row has two 8s. In the output, the first row has four 8s. If each 8 creates a 3x3 block, that might not fit. Alternatively, each number is being placed in three different positions in the output: original, shifted by 3, and shifted by 6. For instance, each non-zero cell in the input is copied to (row, col), (row+3, col+3), and (row+6, col+6). Let's test this.\n\nTake Example0's input:\n\nRow 0, columns 0 and 1 have 8. So in the output, they should be in (0,0), (3,3), (6,6) and (0,1), (3,4), (6,7). Let's check the output. In row 0, columns 0 and1 are 8, and columns3 and4 are 8. So that's (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4). Hmm, but according to the shift idea, (0,0) would copy to (3,3) and (6,6). So why does row0 have 8s at 3 and4? Maybe the shift is in both directions. Wait, perhaps the shift is by 3 columns but same row. But that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is created by overlapping three copies of the input grid: the original, shifted 3 columns to the right, and shifted 6 columns to the right. But how would the rows work? Let me check Example0's output. The first row has 8s at 0,1 (original) and 3,4 (shifted 3 columns), but then where are the 6th column shifts? Not present. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the input is split into 3x3 blocks, and each block is scaled up. For example, each cell in the input's 3x3 area is expanded to a 3x3 block in the output. But the input here is 9x9, so each 3x3 block in input becomes 3x3 in output? That might not make sense. Wait, maybe the input is a 3x3 grid that's repeated three times. For example, the input's rows 0-2 are the original, rows 3-5 are a shifted version, and rows 6-8 are another shift. But the input in Example0 has non-zero entries only in the first three rows, and the output has non-zero entries in the first three, then rows 3-5, then 6-8 again. So maybe each original row is placed in three different rows in the output. For example, row0 of input is placed in rows 0,3,6 of the output. Similarly, row1 in 1,4,7, row2 in 2,5,8. Then for columns, each column in the input is spread to columns 0,3,6. Wait, let's check Example0's input. Input row0: [8,8,0,0,...]. Output rows0,3,6: row0 has [8,8,0,8,8...], row3 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0], row6 is [8,8,0,...]. So maybe each input row is split into three parts, each part placed in a different section of the output. Alternatively, the input is divided into 3x3 blocks, each of which is expanded into 3x3 blocks in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each number in the input is placed in the output in their original position, as well as in positions (row +3, col), (row, col+3), (row+3, col+3), etc. But that's getting complicated.\n\nLooking at Example2's input and output. The input has 6s arranged in a sort of T-shape in the first three rows. The output adds similar shapes shifted down and to the right. For example, in row3 of the output, there are 6s in columns0 and 6. Then row4 has 6s in columns0, 2, 6, 8. Row5 has 6s in columns0 and 6. So perhaps each original 6 is copied to positions 3 rows down and/or 3 columns to the right.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each number is being spread out in a way that the output grid is a combination of the original grid and its rotations. For example, rotating the original pattern by 120 and 240 degrees and combining them. But in Example1, the output seems to have the original 7s mirrored and expanded in a diamond shape, which could be rotations.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the input convolved with a certain kernel. For example, in Example0, the 8s are arranged in a way that suggests a kernel that spreads each 8 to the right and down, perhaps in a 3x3 pattern.\n\nWait, another approach: For each non-zero element in the input, place copies in the output in positions (row + k*3, col + k*3) mod9 for k=0,1,2. So each original element is placed in three positions, spaced 3 apart in both directions. Let's check Example0.\n\nOriginal input in Example0 has 8 at (0,0). Then in output, it should be at (0,0), (3,3), (6,6). Looking at the output:\n\nRow0: columns0 and1 have 8. Original (0,0) would have copies at (3,3) and (6,6). But row0's columns3 and4 also have 8s. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-zero element is being copied to three different quadrants. For example, each element is placed in the original position, then in a position 3 rows down and 3 columns right, then 6 rows down and 6 columns right (mod 9). Let's test for Example0.\n\nTake the 8 at (0,0):\n\nOriginal: (0,0)\nShifted by 3: (3,3)\nShifted by 6: (6,6)\nIn the output, row0 has 8s at (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4). So maybe the original 8 at (0,0) is placed in (0,0), (3,3), (6,6). Then the 8 at (0,1) is placed at (0,1), (3,4), (6,7). Then in row0, we have these 8s. Similarly, row3 would have 8s at (3,3) and (3,4), etc. Looking at the output for Example0, in row3, there are 8s at columns6 and7. Which would correspond to the shifted positions of (0,0) and (0,1) shifted by 3. Hmm, (0,0)+3 would be (3,3), but in row3, columns6 and7. So that's not matching. Maybe the shift is different.\n\nAlternatively, the shift could be 3 rows down and same column. Or same row and 3 columns right. But how?\n\nAnother idea: Each non-zero element in the input is creating a cross shape in the output, spanning 3 rows and 3 columns. For example, the element is placed in the same position, then three rows down, three columns right, and three rows and columns down. But again, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example1's input and output. The input has a small cluster of 7s in rows3-5. The output has a diamond pattern spreading out from those positions. For instance, row3 in input has a 7 at column5. In the output, row3 has a 7 at column5 (original) and column8 (shifted 3 right). Then rows above and below also have 7s spreading out. Maybe the transformation involves creating a mirror image or expanding the original shape in all directions, but every three steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number is being reflected along the center. For example, the output is the input plus its mirror image across the center. But in Example0, the input has 8s in the first three rows, and the output has similar patterns in the last three rows. So maybe the output is the input plus its rotated version by 180 degrees. But that doesn't exactly match.\n\nWait, let's take Example0's output. The first three rows are similar to the input, then rows3-5 have shifted 8s, and rows6-8 are again like the input. So maybe the pattern is that the input is repeated three times, each shifted by 3 rows and 3 columns. So input rows0-2 are the original, then shifted down and right by 3 to rows3-5, and again shifted to rows6-8. But columns as well. For example, in Example0's input, row0 has [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. In the output, row0 is [8,8,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]. So the first two 8s are original, then 8s at positions3 and4. That might be the original shifted three columns. Then row3 in the output has [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0], which would be the original shifted three rows and three columns. And row6 has the original again. So perhaps the output is a combination of the original grid, the grid shifted three right, and the grid shifted three down and three right. But how does that create the pattern?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by tiling the input in a 3x3 grid. Each 3x3 section of the output is a copy of the input. But since the input is 9x9, that would require the output to be 27x27, which is not the case here. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother approach: Look for symmetry in the output. In Example0's output, rows6-8 are the same as the input's rows0-2. So maybe after 6 rows, the pattern repeats. Similarly, columns may repeat every 3. So the transformation is to repeat the input pattern every 3 rows and columns. But how does that explain the middle rows?\n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero element in the input, the output places the same number in positions that are 3 cells to the right and/or 3 cells down, modulo the grid size. For instance, if there's a number at (r,c), then (r, c), (r, c+3), (r, c+6), (r+3, c), (r+3, c+3), etc. Let's test this for Example0.\n\nOriginal 8s in input:\n\nRow0, col0: 8. So in output, it would be at (0,0), (0,3), (0,6), (3,0), (3,3), (3,6), (6,0), (6,3), (6,6). But looking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0 has 8s at 0,1,3,4. So perhaps this theory is incorrect. But maybe the shift is different.\n\nAlternatively, each number is replicated in a 3x3 grid around its original position, but offset by 3. For example, each number is placed in a 3x3 block starting at (r, c), (r, c+3), (r, c+6), and same for rows. But this would create 9 copies. That's too many.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's output, the 7s form a diamond pattern that starts from the input positions and expands outward in all directions. The original input has 7s in rows3-5, columns3-5. The output has 7s spreading to higher and lower rows and columns. For instance, row0 column8 has a 7. So perhaps the transformation is that each 7 is copied to positions (r-3, c), (r, c-3), (r+3, c), (r, c+3), etc., but not overlapping. But how?\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output is larger than the input in terms of the spread of numbers. For example, in Example1, the input has 7s in the middle rows, and the output has them spreading to the edges. So maybe the numbers are being moved outward in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves rotating the original pattern by 180 degrees and combining it with the original. But in Example0, the original has 8s in the first rows, and the output has 8s in the last rows as well. But that might not explain the middle rows.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as a torus (wrapping around edges). Then each non-zero cell is copied to cells that are 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down. For example, (r, c) in input becomes (r, c), (r+3, c+3), (r+6, c+6) in the output. Let's check Example0.\n\nOriginal 8s in row0, col0: (0,0). So in output, they would be at (0,0), (3,3), (6,6). Looking at the output of Example0:\n\n- Row0: 8 at (0,0) and (0,1), etc. So (0,0) is present. Then (3,3) would be in row3, column3. In row3 of output, 8s are at 6 and7. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 3 rows down and 3 columns right. So original (0,0) becomes (3,3), and (3,3) becomes (6,6), and (6,6) becomes (9,9) which wraps to (0,0). So each 8 is placed in three positions. Let's check Example0's output. The original 8s are in rows0,1,2. In the output, rows3-5 have 8s in columns6,7, etc. But for example, original (0,0) would become (3,3). In output row3, the 8s are at 6 and7. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero element is being moved to the right by 3 and down by 3, and then again by another 3 steps. But in Example0, the original 8s in row0, column0 and1 would move to row3, columns3 and4, and then to row6, columns6 and7. Let's look at the output:\n\n- Row0: 8s at0,1,3,4. Row3: 8s at6,7. Row6:8s at0,1. So maybe it's a circular shift where after shifting 3, then another 3 wraps around. So shifting 3 to the right and down from row0, column0 would be row3, column3. Then shifting another 3 would be row6, column6. So in the output, the original 8 is placed in (0,0), (3,3), (6,6). So for the first row of input which has 8s at0 and1, the output would have:\n\n(0,0), (3,3), (6,6) for the first 8.\n\n(0,1), (3,4), (6,7) for the second 8.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0 has 8s at0,1,3,4. The 3 and4 positions would correspond to shifting the original 0 and1 by 3 columns but same row. That doesn't fit the previous idea. So perhaps the shift is not only down and right but also other directions.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the first three rows have 8s in their original positions and also shifted three columns to the right. Then rows3-5 have 8s shifted three rows down and three columns right. And rows6-8 have the original positions again. So perhaps the output is a combination of the original input, the input shifted three columns right, and the input shifted three rows down and three columns right. But overlapping.\n\nFor instance, row0 of output is input row0 plus input row0 shifted three columns right. Then row3 is input row0 shifted three rows down and three columns right. And row6 is input row0 shifted six rows down (which is row0 again modulo9). But how does this apply to the other rows?\n\nAlternatively, each row in the input is replicated three times in the output, shifted by 0, 3, and6 columns. For example, input row0 becomes output rows0,3,6. Each of these rows has the original columns shifted by 0,3,6. But the output rows in Example0's row0 have both the original and shifted columns. So maybe each input row is spread across three output rows, each shifted by 0,3,6 columns. Then, overlapping cells would sum or take the max. But in the output, the numbers don't sum; they're replaced. So perhaps each input row is copied into three output rows with shifts.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think of each example's transformation step-by-step.\n\nExample0's input has 8s in:\n\nRow0: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOther rows are zeros.\n\nThe output has:\n\nRow0: [8,8,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow6: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nObserving that rows0-2 of the output have the original 8s and additional 8s three columns to the right. Rows3-5 have 8s that are three rows down and three columns to the right from the original positions. Rows6-8 are the same as the input rows0-2. So the output is the input combined with a shifted version (3 right and 3 down) and another shifted version (6 right and 6 down, which loops back to original positions).\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each non-zero element in the input, place it in the original position, as well as shifted three columns right and three rows down, and again shifted six columns right and six rows down (mod9). So each element appears in three positions.\n\nLet's test this for Example0's input:\n\nOriginal 8s:\n\nRow0, col0: 8 \u2192 (0,0), (3,3), (6,6)\n\nRow0, col1: 8 \u2192 (0,1), (3,4), (6,7)\n\nRow1, col2:8 \u2192 (1,2), (4,5), (7,8)\n\nRow2, col0:8 \u2192 (2,0), (5,3), (8,6)\n\nNow check the output:\n\nRow0 has 8s at0,1,3,4. So (0,0), (0,1), (3,3), (3,4) shifted to row0. Wait, no. According to the previous idea, shifted by 3 would be (3,3) and (3,4). But in row0, we have 8s at0,1,3,4. How does that happen?\n\nAh, perhaps the shift is applied in columns only for some cases and rows for others. Maybe the shift is applied in three different ways: original, shifted right 3, shifted down3. Or perhaps there's a combination of shifts in rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero element, the output places copies in positions:\n\noriginal (r, c)\n\nshifted down 3 rows and same column (r+3, c)\n\nshifted right 3 columns and same row (r, c+3)\n\nshifted down3 and right3 (r+3, c+3)\n\nBut Example0's row0 has four 8s: two original and two shifted right. So the shifted right would be (0,0+3)= (0,3) and (0,1+3)= (0,4). So original plus shifted right. Then row3 would have shifted down3: (0+3,0)= (3,0) and (0+3,1)= (3,1), and shifted down3 and right3: (3,3), (3,4). But looking at Example0's row3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0]. So the 8s are at columns6 and7, which is (3,6) and (3,7). Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is in both directions. For example, each 8 is copied to positions (r, c), (r, c+3), (r+3, c), (r+3, c+3). So four copies. For example, in Example0's row0, col0: 8 would be at (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3). But in the output, row0 has 8s at0,1,3,4. So maybe this is happening for each 8 in the input.\n\nBut for row0's col0, adding shifted right by 3 would be (0,3). Adding shifted down3 would be (3,0). And shifted down3 and right3 would be (3,3). So four 8s. But in Example0's output row0, there are 8s at 0,1,3,4. This suggests that the two 8s in row0 (col0 and1) each generate four positions, but how?\n\nAlternatively, each 8 is replicated in a 2x2 grid of 3x3 cells. For example, each 8 is placed in a block of 3x3 cells, but spaced every 3 cells. Like, the original and then every third cell. This is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps the key is that the transformation involves creating a larger pattern by replicating the input's non-zero elements in positions offset by multiples of 3 in rows and/or columns. This seems to fit Example0 and Example1.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nInput is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe non-zero elements are in rows3-5, columns0-2. So applying the pattern from the training examples, each 2 should be replicated in positions shifted by 3 and 6 in rows and columns.\n\nAssuming the pattern is that each number is placed in three positions: original, (r+3, c+3), and (r+6, c+6).\n\nSo for each 2 in the input:\n\nRow3, column0: 2 \u2192 (3,0), (6,3), (0,6)\n\nRow4, column0:2 \u2192 (4,0), (7,3), (1,6)\n\nRow4, column1:2 \u2192 (4,1), (7,4), (1,7)\n\nRow5, column1:2 \u2192 (5,1), (8,4), (2,7)\n\nRow5, column2:2 \u2192 (5,2), (8,5), (2,8)\n\nNow, let's see what the output would look like.\n\nOriginal positions (rows3-5, 0-2):\n\nRow3: [2,0,0...]\n\nRow4: [2,2,0...]\n\nRow5: [0,2,2...]\n\nShifted by 3 rows and columns:\n\nRow6: columns3: 2 from (3,0) \u2192 (6,3)\n\nRow7: columns3 and4: from row4's (0,1) shifted \u2192 (7,3) and (7,4)\n\nRow8: columns4 and5: from row5's (1,2) shifted \u2192 (8,4) and (8,5)\n\nShifted by 6 rows and columns (mod9):\n\nRow0: columns6: from (3,0) \u2192 (0,6)\n\nRow1: columns6 and7: from row4's (0,1) \u2192 (1,6) and (1,7)\n\nRow2: columns7 and8: from row5's (1,2) \u2192 (2,7) and (2,8)\n\nSo combining all these, the output should have:\n\nIn row3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (original)\n\nRow4: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (original)\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] (original)\n\nPlus their shifted positions.\n\nRow6: column3 \u2192 2 from (3,0) shifted by 3.\n\nRow7: columns3 and4 \u2192 2 from (4,0) and (4,1) shifted by3.\n\nRow8: columns4 and5 \u2192 2 from (5,1) and (5,2) shifted by3.\n\nRow0: column6 \u21922 from (3,0) shifted by6.\n\nRow1: columns6 and7 \u21922 from (4,0) and (4,1) shifted by6.\n\nRow2: columns7 and8 \u21922 from (5,1) and (5,2) shifted by6.\n\nAdditionally, the shifted positions from row3-5 shifted by3 and6.\n\nSo putting this all together, the output grid would have 2s in:\n\nOriginal positions (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2).\n\nShifted by3: (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5).\n\nShifted by6: (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8).\n\nBut also, any other positions from overlapping shifts. Wait, for example, the original (4,0) shifted by3 would be (7,3). Shifting (4,0) by6 would be (1,6). Similarly, (4,1) shifted by3 is (7,4), by6 is (1,7). (5,1) shifted by3 is (8,4), by6 is (2,7). (5,2) shifted by3 is (8,5), by6 is (2,8).\n\nSo the output would have 2s in:\n\nRow3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0] (from (3,0) shifted by3)\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0] (from (4,0) and (4,1) shifted by3)\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0] (from (5,1) and (5,2) shifted by3)\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0] (from (3,0) shifted by6)\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0] (from (4,0) and (4,1) shifted by6)\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2] (from (5,1) and (5,2) shifted by6)\n\nBut looking at Example0's output, the pattern includes overlapping shifts. For instance, in row0 of Example0, the 8s are from original and shifted right by3. So perhaps the shifting is done for each element, but overlapping elements are merged. So combining all these shifts, the output would have 2s in the original positions, shifted by3, and shifted by6.\n\nPutting this all together, the test input's output should have 2s in:\n\nOriginal rows3-5, cols0-2.\n\nShifted by3: rows6-8, cols3-5.\n\nShifted by6: rows0-2, cols6-8.\n\nSo the output grid would look like:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes the shifted positions also have other elements. For example, in Example0's output row0, there are 8s in the original positions and shifted right by3. So maybe the shift is not only rows and columns down but also other directions. Wait, perhaps the shift is three to the right for each element. So original 2s are in rows3-5 cols0-2. Shifting three to the right would be cols3-5. So those would be in rows3-5 cols3-5. Shifting another three would be cols6-8.\n\nBut the training examples don't show this. Example0's input has 8s in row0 cols0-1, and output has them shifted to row0 cols3-4. So three to the right. Then in row3, cols6-7, which is three to the right and three down.\n\nSo maybe each element is shifted three to the right and three down, then three to the right and three down again.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nOriginal 2s are at:\n\n(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2).\n\nShifted once: (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5).\n\nShifted twice: (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8).\n\nSo the output would have 2s in these positions.\n\nThus, the output rows would look like:\n\nRow0: col6 \u21922.\n\nRow1: cols6 and7 \u21922.\n\nRow2: cols7 and8 \u21922.\n\nRow3: col0 \u21922.\n\nRow4: cols0 and1 \u21922.\n\nRow5: cols1 and2 \u21922.\n\nRow6: col3 \u21922.\n\nRow7: cols3 and4 \u21922.\n\nRow8: cols4 and5 \u21922.\n\nBut in the training examples, the output also includes the original positions. For instance, Example0's output has the original 8s plus the shifted ones. So in the test case, the output would have the original 2s, shifted by3, and shifted by6.\n\nThus, the output should be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are more complex. For instance, Example2's output includes 6s in positions that are not just shifts of the original, but also mirrored or forming a larger pattern. However, the pattern we're deducing for the test input seems to fit the shifts observed in the training examples.\n\nTherefore, applying this pattern to the test input should give the answer as outlined.",
