        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers, and the output is another grid. The task is to transform the input into the output based on the examples given.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input has several rows, most of them filled with 0s and 1s, except near the bottom where there are some numbers like 3,1,7 and 2,8,9, etc. The output is three rows with numbers like [3,0,7], [0,8,0], [3,0,6]. Hmm. Maybe those numbers are taken from specific positions in the input?\n\nLooking at the input rows in Example 0, the last few non-zero rows before the output are:\n\nRow 19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 20: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 21: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output rows are:\n\n[3,0,7]\n[0,8,0]\n[3,0,6]\n\nWait, the first output row is 3,0,7. Looking at row 19, the non-zero numbers are 3,1,7 at positions 7,8,9. But the output has 3,0,7. Maybe the middle element is skipped? Or perhaps it's taking elements from specific columns. The 3 is from position 7, then 7 is from position 9. So maybe every third element or something? Or maybe the output is taking elements from the non-zero parts of those bottom rows, but ignoring zeros. But how?\n\nWait in Example 0's output, the first line is [3,0,7]. Let's see: row 19 has 3,1,7. Maybe the output takes the first, middle, and last non-zero elements of that row. But 3,1,7. But the output is 3,0,7. Hmm. That doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's taking the 3 from row 19, the 8 from row 20, and the 7 from row 19 again. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the output rows in Example 0:\n\nThe first output row is [3,0,7]. The second is [0,8,0]. Third is [3,0,6]. So the 3 in the first and third rows could be from row 19 and 21. The 8 is from row 20's middle element. 7 is from row 19's last non-zero element, 6 from row 21's last non-zero. So maybe each output row is taking elements from the corresponding input rows. Like first output row takes elements from row 19, second from row 20, third from row 21. But in Example 0, the output rows are three, and the input has three non-zero rows at the bottom. So each output row corresponds to an input row, but only selecting certain elements.\n\nLooking at the first output row [3,0,7]. The input row 19 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The non-zero elements are 3,1,7. But the output is 3,0,7. So perhaps they took the first non-zero (3), then 0, then the last non-zero (7). But why the middle is zero? Alternatively, maybe they are taking the elements from columns where the numbers are, but skipping the middle. Or perhaps there's a specific pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero numbers from each of the bottom rows, but in a certain way. For example, row 19: 3,1,7. If you sum or concatenate them, but the output is 3,0,7. Hmm. Not sure. Let's check Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's bottom rows are:\n\nRow 19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 20: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 21: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2,0,7]\n[4,8,0]\n[0,6,1]\n\nSo row 19 in input gives [2,0,7]. The non-zero elements in row 19 are 2,1,7. But the output is 2,0,7. So again, the middle element is missing, replaced by zero. Similarly, row 20's input has 4,8,9. Output is [4,8,0]. The third element is zero. Row 21's input has 8,6,1. Output is [0,6,1], first element zero. Hmm, this seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe it's taking the first two elements and the last, but inserting a zero in between. Wait, in Example 0's first output row [3,0,7], the input row has 3,1,7. So maybe the output takes the first and last, and replaces the middle with zero. Similarly, in Example 1's first output row [2,0,7], input row 19 has 2,1,7. So first and last, middle becomes zero. For row 20's output [4,8,0], input row 20 has 4,8,9. So first two elements, and zero instead of the third? Wait that doesn't fit. Or maybe the output takes the first element, middle element, and last element, but in some positions. Or maybe it's taking elements from specific columns.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 19: the non-zero elements are at positions 7,8,9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexing). Let's check 0-based. The row is:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,7,0,...\n\nSo indices 7:3, 8:1, 9:7. The output row is [3,0,7]. So taking the 7th index (3), then 0, then the 9th index (7). But why the middle is zero? Or maybe the output rows are formed by taking certain columns from the input rows. For example, each output row is formed by taking the first non-zero element in the row, then the middle non-zero, then the last. But that doesn't explain the zeros in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the numbers from the input's bottom non-zero rows, but in a way that combines adjacent rows. For example, in Example 0, the output rows are three. The input's last three non-zero rows are 19,20,21. The output rows are:\n\n[3,0,7] \u2192 from row 19: 3,1,7 \u2192 perhaps 3, (something else), 7.\n\nBut the middle element is 0. Wait, maybe there's another part of the input that's influencing this. Let's look at the rest of the input. The first part of the input in Example 0 has a lot of 1s arranged in certain patterns. Maybe those 1s form a shape, and the output numbers are related to that shape. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output numbers are derived from some operation on the shapes in the input. For example, the number of 1s in certain regions. But the outputs in Example 0 have numbers like 3,7,8,6 which are present in the input's bottom rows.\n\nWait, but the outputs seem to directly take numbers from the bottom rows. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's output rows:\n\n[3,0,7] \u2192 3 from row 19, column 7; 7 from row 19, column 9. The middle is 0. But why?\n\nExample 1's output:\n\n[2,0,7] \u2192 2 from row 19, column 8; 7 from column 10.\n\nWait, maybe the output rows are taking the first, middle, and last non-zero elements from each of the bottom rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's row 19 (non-zeros 3,1,7), first is 3, middle is 1, last is 7. But the output is [3,0,7]. So middle becomes 0. Why?\n\nWait, perhaps the middle element is taken from another row. For example, in the first output row of Example 0: 3 (from row19), 8 (from row20's middle), 7 (from row19's last). But that would make [3,8,7], but the output is [3,0,7]. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the numbers from the bottom rows, but only the non-zero numbers, and padding with zeros if needed. For example, in Example 0's row19, the non-zero numbers are 3,1,7. Output row is three elements, but the middle is zero. So perhaps they are taking the first and last and inserting a zero in the middle. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 2's output:\n\nThe input's bottom rows are:\n\nRow 16: [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,4,1,9,4,0]\nRow17: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6,1,0]\nRow18: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,5,7,5,0]\nRow19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,2,7,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[4,0,9,4]\n[6,0,6,0]\n[3,0,0,5]\n[2,4,2,0]\n\nLooking at row16's input: the non-zero elements at the end are 4,1,9,4. The output row is [4,0,9,4]. So first, then 0, then 9, then 4. Wait, but input has 4,1,9,4. So maybe taking first, third, and fourth elements? But output has four elements. So perhaps it's taking the first, inserting a zero, then the next two? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions: in row16, the non-zero elements start at position 17 (0-based: let's check). The row is [0,0,8,...8,0,0,0,4,1,9,4,0]. The non-zero at the end are positions 17:4, 18:1, 19:9, 20:4. The output is [4,0,9,4]. So taking 4 (pos17), 0, 9 (pos19), 4 (pos20). So why skip pos18 (1) and add zero. Maybe every other element?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the bottom rows, but replacing certain elements with zeros. Like, in the first output row, the second element is zero. So for row16's input, non-zero elements are 4,1,9,4. Output is [4,0,9,4]. So the second element (1) is replaced by zero. Similarly, in row17's input, non-zero elements are 6,3,6,1. Output is [6,0,6,0]. The third element (6) remains, but the last becomes zero? Wait, in row17's input: positions 17:6, 18:3, 19:6, 20:1. Output [6,0,6,0]. So positions 17,19, and zeros for 18 and 20? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern across all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\n3 0 7\n0 8 0\n3 0 6\n\nThe numbers 3,7,8,3,6 are present in the input's bottom rows. For example, 3 from row19, 7 from row19; 8 from row20; 3 from row21, 6 from row21.\n\nExample 1's output:\n\n2 0 7\n4 8 0\n0 6 1\n\nThese numbers are from the input's bottom rows: 2 (row19),7 (row19),4 (row20),8 (row20),9 becomes 0 in output? Wait row20's input has 4,8,9. Output is [4,8,0]. So 9 is replaced by 0. Hmm. Then row21's input has 8,6,1. Output [0,6,1]. So 8 is replaced by 0.\n\nExample 2's output:\n\n4 0 9 4\n6 0 6 0\n3 0 0 5\n2 4 2 0\n\nThese numbers are from the input's bottom rows. For example, row16's input has 4,1,9,4 \u2192 output [4,0,9,4]. Row17's input has 6,3,6,1 \u2192 output [6,0,6,0]. Row18's input has 3,5,7,5 \u2192 output [3,0,0,5]. Row19's input has 2,4,2,7 \u2192 output [2,4,2,0]. So it seems that in each row of the output, certain elements are kept, and others are replaced by zeros.\n\nThe pattern might be that in each of the bottom rows of the input (the ones with non-zero numbers at the end), the output takes the first element, skips the next (or replaces with zero), then takes the next, etc. For example, in Example 0's row19 (3,1,7), the output is [3,0,7]. So first, zero, then third element. In row20 (2,8,9), output [0,8,0]. Wait, that's middle element kept. Hmm, inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are taking every other element, starting from the first, and inserting zeros. For example, in row19's input (3,1,7), take 3, then zero, then 7. So positions 0 and 2 of the non-zero elements, inserting zero in between.\n\nIn Example 1's row19: 2,1,7 \u2192 output [2,0,7]. So take first and last, insert zero. Similarly, row20:4,8,9 \u2192 output [4,8,0]. Take first two, then zero. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Or perhaps, the number of elements in the output row depends on the number of non-zero elements in the input row. If the input row has three non-zeros, output is three elements, with middle as zero. If four non-zeros, output is four elements with even indices kept and odd replaced by zero?\n\nIn Example 2's row16 input has four non-zero elements (4,1,9,4). Output [4,0,9,4]. So even indices (0,2,3) kept? Wait 4 is index0, 1 is index1, 9 index2, 4 index3. Output is 4 (0), 0 (1), 9 (2), 4 (3). So keeping even indices? No, 4 is index0, 9 index2, 4 index3. Hmm. So not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the output, for each row, the first and last elements are kept, and the middle elements are set to zero. But in Example 0's row20 input has 2,8,9. Output is [0,8,0]. So first and last are set to zero. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the positions of the non-zero elements in the input's bottom rows. For example, in Example0's row19, the non-zeros are at columns 7,8,9 (assuming 0-based). The output is three elements. Maybe the columns are shifted. Or perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements, but in a different order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the digits in the input's bottom rows and combining them. For instance, in Example0's row19 (3,1,7) and row20 (2,8,9) and row21 (3,4,6), perhaps the output is combining these rows vertically. For example, the first output row takes the first elements of each row: 3,2,3 \u2192 but no, the output rows are three. Wait, maybe each output column is a combination. For example, first output row is 3 (row19's first), 0, 7 (row19's third). But where does the zero come from?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero digits from the bottom rows and arranging them in a specific pattern. For example, in Example0, the bottom rows have:\n\nRow19: 3,1,7\n\nRow20:2,8,9\n\nRow21:3,4,6\n\nThe output is three rows:\n\n3 0 7\n\n0 8 0\n\n3 0 6\n\nSo the 3 from row19, 7 from row19; 8 from row20; 3 from row21, 6 from row21. The other positions are zeros. So it's like taking the corners and the center. The first row of the output has the first and last elements of row19, the second row has the middle of row20, and the third row has the first and last of row21. The middle positions are zeros.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\nRow19: 2,1,7 \u2192 output [2,0,7]\n\nRow20:4,8,9 \u2192 output [4,8,0]\n\nRow21:8,6,1 \u2192 output [0,6,1]\n\nSo first row takes first and last, middle zero. Second row takes first two, last zero. Third row takes last two, first zero. Hmm, this inconsistency makes it hard.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the transpose of the non-zero parts of the input's bottom rows. For example, in Example0's bottom three rows:\n\n3 1 7\n\n2 8 9\n\n3 4 6\n\nIf you transpose them, you get:\n\n3 2 3\n\n1 8 4\n\n7 9 6\n\nBut the output is:\n\n3 0 7\n\n0 8 0\n\n3 0 6\n\nNot matching. But maybe taking the diagonal elements. The diagonal would be 3,8,6 \u2192 but that's the third output row's last element. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element of each row, then the second, then the third, but inserting zeros where there are no elements. But again, not sure.\n\nLooking at the test input now. The test input has a grid, and the bottom non-zero rows are:\n\nRow15: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8,6,3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,3,3,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow17: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,7,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow18: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,8,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo each of these rows has non-zero elements starting at column 15 (0-based?), e.g., 4,8,6,3 in row15.\n\nIf the pattern from the training examples is to take certain elements from these rows, perhaps the output for the test input would be:\n\nFor row15: [4,8,6,3]. If following Example2's pattern where four elements are taken and some replaced with zero. In Example2's output, the first row was [4,0,9,4], which corresponds to input row16's 4,1,9,4. So the output is first, zero, third, fourth.\n\nIf that's the case, maybe the test input's row15 (4,8,6,3) would become [4,0,6,3]. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output for each row is formed by taking the first and last elements and putting zeros in between. For example, row15's 4,8,6,3 \u2192 output [4,0,0,3]. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a pattern in the training outputs:\n\nExample0's output rows:\n\nRow1: [3,0,7] \u2192 input row19:3,1,7 \u2192 output first and last, zero in middle.\n\nRow2: [0,8,0] \u2192 input row20:2,8,9 \u2192 middle element kept, others zero.\n\nRow3: [3,0,6] \u2192 input row21:3,4,6 \u2192 first and last, zero in middle.\n\nExample1's output:\n\nRow1: [2,0,7] \u2192 input row19:2,1,7 \u2192 first and last.\n\nRow2: [4,8,0] \u2192 input row20:4,8,9 \u2192 first two, last zero.\n\nRow3: [0,6,1] \u2192 input row21:8,6,1 \u2192 last two, first zero.\n\nHmm. Not sure. Another angle: Maybe the output is formed by taking the digits from the input's bottom rows but arranged vertically. For example, in Example0, the first output row is 3,0,7. The second is 0,8,0. Third is 3,0,6. If you stack them:\n\n3 0 7\n\n0 8 0\n\n3 0 6\n\nThis looks like the digits are arranged in a vertical line. The middle column has 0,8,0. The 8 is from row20's middle. The first column has 3,0,3, which could be from row19 and 21's first element. The third column has 7,0,6 from row19's third and row21's third. But how does this fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotated version of the non-zero parts. Like rotating the matrix 90 degrees. But in Example0's input's bottom rows:\n\n3 1 7\n\n2 8 9\n\n3 4 6\n\nRotated 90 degrees would be:\n\n3 2 3\n\n1 8 4\n\n7 9 6\n\nBut the output is:\n\n3 0 7\n\n0 8 0\n\n3 0 6\n\nNot matching. But maybe selecting certain elements. The output's middle column is all zeros except the center 8, which matches the rotated matrix's middle element (8). The first and last columns have 3,0,3 and 7,0,6. Which doesn't directly match the rotated matrix's first and last columns. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of certain parts of the input. For example, the number of 1s in certain rows or columns. But the numbers in the output are present in the input's bottom rows, so that's unlikely.\n\nLet's try to find another pattern. In Example0's input, the non-zero bottom rows are three. The output is three rows. Each output row corresponds to one input row. For each input row, the output row has the first and last non-zero element, and the middle is zero. For example:\n\nRow19:3,1,7 \u2192 output [3,0,7]\n\nRow20:2,8,9 \u2192 output [0,8,0] \u2192 wait, but why first and last are zero here? This contradicts the previous idea.\n\nBut in Example1's row20:4,8,9 \u2192 output [4,8,0]. So first and middle are kept, last is zero. Not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for each row is the non-zero elements of that row, but replacing the middle elements with zero. For example, if the row has three non-zero elements, replace the middle with zero. If four, replace the middle two with zeros. But in Example2's row16 input has four non-zero elements (4,1,9,4), output [4,0,9,4]. So the second element (1) is replaced with zero. Similarly, row17's input (6,3,6,1) becomes [6,0,6,0], replacing second and fourth elements. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the output is taking the first and last elements of each input row and inserting zeros in between. For example, for a row with three elements, output first, zero, last. For a row with four elements, output first, zero, zero, last. But in Example2's row16 input has four elements, output is [4,0,9,4]. The third element is 9, which is the third in the input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example2's row16 input: 4,1,9,4. Output is [4,0,9,4]. So first element (4), third element (9), fourth element (4). So skipping the second (1) and inserting zero. Not sure.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is to take the first and last non-zero elements of each row, and any elements that are the same as the first or last. For example, if the first is 4 and the last is 4, then keep them and any others that are 4. But in Example0's row19:3,1,7. First is 3, last is7. Output is [3,0,7]. So middle 1 is replaced with zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the non-zero digits and, for each row, only keeping the digits that appear more than once. For example, in Example0's row19:3,1,7. Only 3 and7, but they don't repeat. So maybe not.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Another approach: look at the positions of the non-zero elements in the input's bottom rows and see if they correspond to positions in the output.\n\nIn Example0's input, the non-zero elements in the bottom rows are in columns 7,8,9. The output has three elements per row, possibly columns 0,1,2. Maybe the input's columns 7,8,9 are mapped to output columns 0,1,2. But how? For example, row19's 3 is in input column7 \u2192 output column0. 1 in column8 \u2192 output column1. 7 in column9 \u2192 output column2. But the output row19 is [3,0,7]. So why is the middle zero? Because in the output, the middle element is 0, but the input's column8 is 1. That doesn't explain it. Unless the mapping is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a mirror or some transformation of the input's bottom rows. For example, reversing the order. Row19:3,1,7 \u2192 reversed is7,1,3. But the output is3,0,7. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are constructed by taking the non-zero elements from the input's bottom rows, but only if they are even or odd. But the numbers vary (3,7,8, etc.), so that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a common structure in the output. For example, in Example0's output, each row has three elements. The middle element of the second row is 8, which is the only non-zero there. Maybe the output is the middle row's middle element, and surrounding elements from other rows. But not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the input's upper part (before the bottom rows) has a pattern of 1s. Maybe the output numbers are related to the count of 1s in certain regions. For example, in Example0's input, there are blocks of 1s forming some shapes. The output numbers could be the count of 1s in certain regions. But the numbers in the output (3,7,8,6, etc.) don't seem to match the count of 1s. For example, in Example0's input, rows 1-5 have 5 1s each. That's 5 rows \u00d75 1s =25. But 3 and 7 are not related to 25. So probably not.\n\nBack to the bottom rows. Let's consider that in each example, the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the bottom few rows, but modifying them by replacing certain elements with zero based on their value. For example, any even numbers are kept, and odds are replaced with zero. But in Example0's row19:3 (odd),1 (odd),7 (odd). Output is3,0,7. So 3 and7 are kept (odd), 1 replaced with zero. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the digits and subtracting 1 from the middle elements. Example0's row19:3,1,7 \u2192 3,1-1=0,7 \u2192 [3,0,7]. That fits. Example1's row19:2,1,7 \u21922,0,7. Row20:4,8,9 \u21924,8-1=7? No, output is [4,8,0]. So 9-1=8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first digit, then the sum of the rest, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each row is the first element, then the sum of the middle elements, then the last. But Example0's row19:3, sum(1) =1 \u2192 but output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look at the test input and see if applying any of the guessed patterns would work.\n\nTest input's bottom rows:\n\nRow15: [...,4,8,6,3]\n\nRow16: [...,9,3,3,5]\n\nRow17: [...,6,7,7,4]\n\nRow18: [...,1,5,8,1]\n\nAssuming that each of these rows corresponds to an output row. Let's say for each row, take the first and last non-zero elements, and replace the middle ones with zeros. For example:\n\nRow15:4,8,6,3 \u2192 output [4,0,0,3]\n\nRow16:9,3,3,5 \u2192 [9,0,0,5]\n\nRow17:6,7,7,4 \u2192 [6,0,0,4]\n\nRow18:1,5,8,1 \u2192 [1,0,0,1]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples. For instance, Example2's row16 input (4,1,9,4) outputs [4,0,9,4], which takes the first and third elements. So maybe for four elements, take first, third, and fourth, replacing the second with zero. But how?\n\nAlternatively, take every other element starting from the first. For four elements: positions0,2,3. So [4,9,4] but padded to four elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in Example2's row16 input (4,1,9,4), output is [4,0,9,4]. So positions0,2,3 are kept. So for four elements, keep first, third, fourth, and insert zero in position1.\n\nApplying that to test input's row15:4,8,6,3 \u2192 [4,0,6,3]\n\nRow16:9,3,3,5 \u2192 [9,0,3,5]\n\nRow17:6,7,7,4 \u2192 [6,0,7,4]\n\nRow18:1,5,8,1 \u2192 [1,0,8,1]\n\nBut in Example2's output for row17 input (6,3,6,1), output is [6,0,6,0], which doesn't fit this pattern. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output rows have the same number of elements as the number of non-zero elements in the input row, but with some zeros. For example, in Example0's row19 has three non-zeros \u2192 output has three elements. Example2's row16 has four non-zeros \u2192 output has four elements. So the output row length matches the input's non-zero count.\n\nIn that case, for the test input's row15, which has four non-zeros, output should have four elements. Let's see Example2's row16 input (4,1,9,4) \u2192 output [4,0,9,4]. So the first, third, and fourth elements are kept, the second is zero. So perhaps for four elements, keep first, third, fourth, replace second with zero. But why?\n\nAlternatively, if the input row has an even number of non-zero elements, replace the middle ones with zero. For three elements, replace the middle. For four elements, replace the middle two.\n\nBut for four elements, the middle two would be positions1 and2. Replacing them with zeros would give first,0,0,last. But Example2's row16 output is [4,0,9,4]. So positions0,2,3 are kept. So maybe for four elements, replace position1 with zero, keep others. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, in Example2's row16, the input is 4,1,9,4. Output is [4,0,9,4]. So the middle elements (1) is replaced by zero, but the third (9) is kept. So perhaps replace the second element. For four elements, replace the second element. So in test input's row15:4,8,6,3 \u2192 output [4,0,6,3]. Similarly, row16:9,3,3,5 \u2192 [9,0,3,5]. Row17:6,7,7,4 \u2192 [6,0,7,4]. Row18:1,5,8,1 \u2192 [1,0,8,1].\n\nBut in Example2's row17 input (6,3,6,1), output is [6,0,6,0]. According to this pattern, it should be [6,0,6,1], but actual output is [6,0,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output replaces any element that is not the first or last with zero. For three elements: first, zero, last. For four elements: first, zero, zero, last. But Example2's row16 output is [4,0,9,4], which doesn't fit. First is4, last is4, but third element is9, which is not the last. So this doesn't work.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, perhaps the pattern is that in each of the bottom rows of the input, the output takes the first non-zero element, then zeros, then the last non-zero element. For rows with even number of non-zeros, maybe take the first and last, inserting zeros in between.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow15:4,8,6,3 \u2192 output [4,0,0,3]\n\nRow16:9,3,3,5 \u2192 [9,0,0,5]\n\nRow17:6,7,7,4 \u2192 [6,0,0,4]\n\nRow18:1,5,8,1 \u2192 [1,0,0,1]\n\nBut Example2's row16 input (4,1,9,4) \u2192 output [4,0,9,4]. Which would be first, zero, third, fourth. So not just first and last. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for four elements, take the first, third, and fourth elements, and insert zero in between. So row16's input (4,1,9,4) \u2192 [4,0,9,4]. So for the test input's row15 (4,8,6,3), output would be [4,0,6,3].\n\nBut in Example2's row17 input (6,3,6,1) \u2192 output [6,0,6,0]. So third element is6, which is the same as first. Maybe that's a coincidence.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. The output seems to take the first and last non-zero elements of each bottom row and put zeros in between. For example:\n\nIn Example0's row19:3,1,7 \u2192 [3,0,7]\n\nExample1's row19:2,1,7 \u2192 [2,0,7]\n\nExample2's row16:4,1,9,4 \u2192 [4,0,9,4]\n\nSo applying this to the test input's rows:\n\nRow15:4,8,6,3 \u2192 [4,0,0,3] (if four elements, first and last, zeros in between)\n\nRow16:9,3,3,5 \u2192 [9,0,0,5]\n\nRow17:6,7,7,4 \u2192 [6,0,0,4]\n\nRow18:1,5,8,1 \u2192 [1,0,0,1]\n\nBut looking back at Example2's output for row17 input (6,3,6,1), the output is [6,0,6,0]. So first and third elements are kept, which are 6 and6. So perhaps for even positions, take every other element. But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements and, if they are palindromic, keeping them, else replacing with zero. For example, row19 in Example0:3,1,7 is not a palindrome, so replace the middle with zero. But row21:3,4,6 is not a palindrome, so output [3,0,6].\n\nBut Example2's row16:4,1,9,4 is not a palindrome (4,1,9,4), but output is [4,0,9,4]. So first and fourth are 4, third is9. Not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm running out of time, I'll proceed with the pattern that for each row in the input's bottom non-zero rows, the output takes the first and last non-zero elements and replaces the middle ones with zeros. For three elements: first, 0, last. For four elements: first, 0, 0, last. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample0's row20:2,8,9 \u2192 output [0,8,0]. But according to this pattern, it should be [2,0,9]. But the output is [0,8,0]. So this doesn't fit. Hence, this pattern is incorrect.\n\nAlternative last-ditch effort: The output rows are the non-zero elements of the input's bottom rows, but each digit is shifted down by the number of rows above. For example, in Example0, the bottom rows are rows19-21. The output for row19:3,0,7. Maybe 3+19=22, but not relevant. Not sure.\n\nGiven that I can't find a consistent pattern, I'll look at the test input and see that the bottom rows have four rows with non-zero elements: rows15-18. Each has four non-zero elements. The outputs in the training examples with four elements (Example2) have outputs like [4,0,9,4], which is first, zero, third, fourth. So for the test input's row15 (4,8,6,3), output would be [4,0,6,3]. Row16 (9,3,3,5) \u2192 [9,0,3,5]. Row17 (6,7,7,4) \u2192 [6,0,7,4]. Row18 (1,5,8,1) \u2192 [1,0,8,1].\n\nBut Example2's row17 input (6,3,6,1) outputs [6,0,6,0], which would be first, zero, third, zero. So why is the last element zero? This suggests that the pattern isn't consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for each row is the first element, then the sum of the middle elements, then the last. For Example0's row19:3, sum(1)=1, 7 \u2192 but output is3,0,7. Not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible pattern is that the output takes the first and last non-zero elements from each of the bottom rows and inserts zeros in between. For three elements: [first,0, last]. For four elements: [first,0,0, last]. Applying this to the test input:\n\nRow15:4,8,6,3 \u2192 [4,0,0,3]\n\nRow16:9,3,3,5 \u2192 [9,0,0,5]\n\nRow17:6,7,7,4 \u2192 [6,0,0,4]\n\nRow18:1,5,8,1 \u2192 [1,0,0,1]\n\nBut the example2's row16 input (4,1,9,4) output is [4,0,9,4], which has four elements. So it's first,0, third, fourth. That doesn't fit the pattern. So this approach is invalid.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples. The output seems to take the first non-zero element, then the middle one (if present), then the last, replacing any intermediates with zeros. For example, in Example0's row19:3,1,7 \u2192 output [3,0,7]. In Example1's row20:4,8,9 \u2192 output [4,8,0]. So first and middle, last zero. In Example2's row16:4,1,9,4 \u2192 [4,0,9,4]. So first, zero, third, fourth.\n\nThis inconsistency makes it hard. But perhaps for the test input, each row's output is the first and last elements with zeros in between. So:\n\nRow15:4,8,6,3 \u2192 [4,0,0,3]\n\nRow16:9,3,3,5 \u2192 [9,0,0,5]\n\nRow17:6,7,7,4 \u2192 [6,0,0,4]\n\nRow18:1,5,8,1 \u2192 [1,0,0,1]\n\nBut I'm not confident. However, looking back at the training examples, the outputs have varying numbers of elements. For example, Example0 has three rows of three elements, Example1 three rows of three, Example2 four rows of four elements. The test input's bottom rows have four rows of four elements each, so the output should likely have four rows of four elements each. Following Example2's pattern where each output row is formed by taking the first, third, and fourth elements and inserting a zero in the second position, but Example2's output for row16 input (4,1,9,4) is [4,0,9,4]. So applying that to the test input's rows:\n\nRow15:4,8,6,3 \u2192 [4,0,6,3]\n\nRow16:9,3,3,5 \u2192 [9,0,3,5]\n\nRow17:6,7,7,4 \u2192 [6,0,7,4]\n\nRow18:1,5,8,1 \u2192 [1,0,8,1]\n\nThis matches Example2's pattern. So this would be the answer.",
