        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The goal is to find the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples. Let me start by carefully analyzing each example to spot any similarities or rules.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n[1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4]\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n[0s...]\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n[2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1]\n[0s...]\n[1,4,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nOutput rows:\n[1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4]\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n[0s...]\n[1,4,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n[2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]\n[0s...]\n[1,4,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nHmm. Let's compare input and output. The first row in input starts with 1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4 and becomes 1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4. So the fourth element (index 3) was 1 in input and changed to 4. Wait, the fourth position (index 3) in the first row of input is 1, and in output it's 4. Wait, no, the fourth element in the first row of input is 1 (third position is 0, then fourth is 1). Wait, maybe looking at specific positions. Let's see:\n\nOriginal first input row: positions 0-7 are 1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4.\n\nOutput row: 1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4. So the 4th element (index 4) changed from 1 to 4, and the last element remained 4. Also, the element before the last was 1 in input, and 4 in output. Wait, in the input row, the elements at positions 3 and 4 are 1 and 1. In the output, position 3 is 1 and position 4 is 4. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being mirrored or copied from previous elements.\n\nLooking at the fifth row (index 4) in Example 0's input: [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1] becomes [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]. Here, the fourth element (index 3) changed from 1 to 2, and the sixth element (index 6) was already 2. Wait, input's index 3 was 1, output is 2. Similarly, in the first output row, index 4 became 4. So maybe the elements at positions 3 and 5 (since the pattern is 0s in the middle) are being replaced by the first or last elements.\n\nWait, another approach: looking for symmetry. For example, in the first input row of Example 0, the first element is 1 and the last is 4. In the output, the fourth element (index 3) is 1 (same as input), but the fifth (index 4) is 4. Wait, maybe the elements in positions 3 and 4 are being set to the same as the first and last elements. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: first element is 1, last is 4. The output row's positions 3 and 4 are 1 and 4. So perhaps in the output, position 3 is the same as the first element, and position 4 is the same as the last element. Let's test this.\n\nOriginal input row 0: [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4]. Output row: [1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4]. Position 3 was 1 (same as first element 1), and position 4 was 4 (same as last element 4). That fits. Similarly, for the row [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1], the output is [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]. Here, first element is 2, last is 1. Output positions 3 and 4 are 2 and 1, matching first and last.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 1: [1,3,0,1,1,0,1,3] becomes [1,3,0,1,3,0,1,3]. The first element is 1, last is 3. Output positions 3 and 4 are 1 and 3. Wait, in the output, position 3 is 1 (same as first), position 4 is 3 (same as last). So this seems to hold.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input row 4: [3,1,0,1,1,0,3,1] becomes [3,1,0,3,1,0,3,1]. First is 3, last is 1. Output positions 3 and 4 are 3 and 1. So again, positions 3 and 4 are set to first and last elements of the row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each row (except maybe the all-zero rows), in the output, the elements at positions 3 and 4 are replaced with the first and last elements of the input row, respectively. Let me check the other rows.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 0: [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1]. Output remains the same. Wait, why? Because the first element is 1, last is 1. So replacing positions 3 and 4 with 1 and 1. But in the input, position 3 is 7 and 4 is 1. So in the output, position 3 would be 1 and 4 would be 1. But in the output, row 0 is [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1], which is same as input. That contradicts. So this theory is wrong here.\n\nWait, so in Example 1's input row 0, output doesn't change. So perhaps the rule isn't applied to every row. Let me check which rows were modified.\n\nIn Example 0, the first row was modified: the 4th element (index 4) changed from 1 to 4. The fourth row (index 4) input: [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1] \u2192 output [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]. So positions 3 and 4 changed from 1,1 to 2,1. So the first element is 2, last is 1. So position 3 became 2 (first element), position 4 became 1 (last element). But in Example 1's input row 0, the first element is 1 and last is 1. So if we apply the same rule, positions 3 and 4 would become 1 and 1. But in the input, position 3 is 7, which in the output remains 7. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the rule is applied only to certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is applied to rows where the first and last elements are the same. Wait, let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's first input row, first element is 1, last is 4. So different. The output changes positions 3 and 4 to first and last. But in Example 1's input row 0, first and last are 1 and 1. So same. But in that case, the output didn't change those positions. Wait, but in Example 1's output row 0 remains the same. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to every row except the all-zero rows. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, row 0: modified. Row 1: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1] \u2192 output same. So first and last are 1 and 1. So if the rule was to set positions 3 and 4 to first and last, then positions 3 and 4 would become 1 and 1. But in the input row 1, positions 3 and 4 are already 1 and 1, so no change. So that's why the output is same. That makes sense.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 1: [1,3,0,1,1,0,1,3]. Output becomes [1,3,0,1,3,0,1,3]. Here, first is 1, last is 3. So positions 3 and 4 would be set to 1 and 3. In input, position 3 is 1 (so remains), position 4 becomes 3. So the output changes position 4 from 1 to 3. So that fits.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 0: [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1]. Output is same. So first and last are 1. So positions 3 and 4 would be set to 1 and 1. But in the input, position 3 is 7 and 4 is 1. So changing 7 to 1 and 1 to 1. But in the output, it remains the same. So that contradicts. Therefore, there's an exception here. Why?\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is applied only to rows that have a non-zero in the third position (index 2) but looking at the examples, the third element is 0 in all rows except the all-zero rows, which are kept as is. Wait, in the input rows, the third element (index 2) is 0 except for the all-zero rows, but in the training examples, the all-zero rows are kept as zeros. So maybe the transformation applies to rows where the third element is 0 (i.e., the non-zero rows except the all-zero ones). Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 0: third element is 0. The transformation is applied. In row 1, third element is 0, transformation is applied (positions 3 and 4 set to first and last). But for row 1, first and last are 1 and 1, so positions 3 and 4 are 1 and 1, which they already are. So output is same.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 0: third element is 0. The first and last are 1. So applying the transformation would set positions 3 and 4 to 1 and 1. But input row 0 has positions 3 as 7 and 4 as 1. So output should set position 3 to 1 and 4 to 1. But in the output, it's left as 7 and 1. So this contradicts. Therefore, maybe the transformation is applied only to certain rows. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, the transformation seems to affect the elements at positions 3 and 4. Let me check if the pattern is to mirror the first and last elements into positions 3 and 4. For example:\n\nOriginal row: [a, b, 0, c, d, 0, e, f]\nOutput becomes [a, b, 0, a, f, 0, e, f]. So positions 3 and 4 are replaced with a and f.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first input row: a=1, f=4. So positions 3 and 4 become 1 and 4. But in the input, position 3 was 1 and 4 was 1. So in output, position 4 becomes 4. So that's correct. For the fourth row in Example 0's input: [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1]. a=2, f=1. So positions 3 and 4 become 2 and 1. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 1: [1,3,0,1,1,0,1,3]. a=1, f=3. So positions 3 and 4 become 1 and 3. Which is what the output shows.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 0: [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1]. a=1, f=1. So positions 3 and 4 should become 1 and 1. But in the output, they remain 7 and 1. So that's a problem. Unless there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe it's not a and f but the first and the seventh element (since the last element is eighth, but perhaps the seventh? Let's check. In Example 0's first input row: elements are [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4]. The seventh element (index 6) is 1. The last (index 7) is 4. So if the rule is to set position 3 to first element and position 4 to seventh element. Then in first row, position 4 would be 1. But in the output, position 4 is 4. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions 3 and 4 are set to the first and last non-zero elements of the row. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: first non-zero is 1, last non-zero is 4. So positions 3 and 4 become 1 and 4.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 0: first non-zero is 1, last is 1. So positions 3 and 4 become 1 and 1. But in output, it's 7 and 1. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, maybe the transformation is applied to certain rows based on their content. Looking at the training examples, it seems that in the output, rows that have the same first and last elements as the input might have their positions 3 and 4 updated. Wait, but in Example 0's first input row, first is 1, last is 4. So different, but positions 3 and 4 were updated. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is applied to rows where the first element is different from the last, and when they are the same, no change. Wait, in Example 0's row 0: first and last are 1 and 4 (different), so positions 3 and 4 are set to 1 and 4. In row 4: first is 2, last is 1 (different), so set to 2 and 1. In Example 1's row 1: first is 1, last is 3 (different), so set to 1 and 3. But in Example 1's row 0: first and last are 1 (same), so no change. Wait, but in that case, the output's row 0 remains the same. But in the input, positions 3 and 4 are 7 and 1. If the rule is that when first and last are the same, leave them as is, else set positions 3 and 4 to first and last. That could explain why in Example 0's row 0 and row 4, and Example 1's row 1, the positions are changed, but in Example 1's row 0, they're not. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nFor Example 1's input row 0: [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1]. First and last are 1 and 1 (same), so positions 3 and 4 are left as 7 and 1. Hence the output remains same. For rows where first and last are different, positions 3 and 4 are set to first and last.\n\nThis seems to fit all training examples. Let's verify:\n\nExample 0, row 0: first=1, last=4 (different). Output positions 3 and 4 are 1 and 4. Correct.\n\nExample 0, row 4: first=2, last=1 (different). Output positions 3 and 4 are 2 and 1. Correct.\n\nExample 1, row 1: first=1, last=3 (different). Output positions 3 and 4 are 1 and 3. Correct.\n\nExample 1, row 0: first=1, last=1. So no change. Correct.\n\nExample 2, row 4: input [3,1,0,1,1,0,3,1]. First=3, last=1 (different). So positions 3 and 4 become 3 and 1. Output is [3,1,0,3,1,0,3,1]. Correct.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: For each row (excluding all-zero rows), if the first and last elements are different, then replace the 4th and 5th elements (indices 3 and 4) with the first and last elements of the row, respectively. If they are the same, leave them as is.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's row 0, the output changes the 4th element (index 4) to 4, which is the last element. So index 3 is first, index 4 is last.\n\nYes, in that case, the positions 3 and 4 are set to first and last elements.\n\nNow let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1] \u2192 first and last are 1 and 1 (same), so no change. Output row 0 remains same.\n\nRow 1: [1,8,0,1,1,0,1,8] \u2192 first=1, last=8 (different). So positions 3 and 4 become 1 and 8. So input positions 3 and 4 are 1 and 1. Output row 1 would be [1,8,0,1,8,0,1,8].\n\nRow 2: all zeros \u2192 unchanged.\n\nRow 3: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1] \u2192 first and last 1, no change.\n\nRow 4: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1] \u2192 same as row 3. No change.\n\nRow 5: zeros.\n\nRow 6: [6,1,0,1,1,0,6,1] \u2192 first=6, last=1 (different). So positions 3 and 4 become 6 and 1. So the input row is [6,1,0,1,1,0,6,1]. Output row would be [6,1,0,6,1,0,6,1].\n\nRow 7: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,8] \u2192 first=1, last=8 (different). So positions 3 and 4 become 1 and 8. So output row becomes [1,1,0,1,8,0,1,8].\n\nPutting it all together, the output rows should be:\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n[1,8,0,1,8,0,1,8]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[6,1,0,6,1,0,6,1]\n[1,1,0,1,8,0,1,8]\n\nNow, let me check the format. Each output list should have the same structure as the training examples. The all-zero rows are kept as is. Rows where first and last are same remain unchanged, others have positions 3 and 4 replaced with first and last.\n\nYes, this seems correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. Let me compare the input and output rows. \n\nTake the first input row: [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4]. The output is [1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4]. Hmm, I notice that the fifth element changed from 1 to 4. Similarly, the fourth element in the output is 1 (same as input), but fifth is now 4. Let me check other rows.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth row input: [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1]. Output becomes [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]. So the fourth element changes from 1 to 2, and the sixth remains 0. Wait, the fourth and sixth positions are modified here. Wait, maybe looking for specific positions.\n\nWait, let's check positions 3 and 4 (since lists are 0-indexed or 1-indexed? Probably 0-indexed here). Let's index starting at 0:\n\nOriginal first input row: positions 0:1, 1:4, 2:0, 3:1, 4:1, 5:0, 6:1,7:4. Output row: positions 3 becomes 1 (same?), no, wait original input's position 3 is 1, output is 1. Position 4 in input is 1, output is 4. Oh, so maybe in certain rows, the fourth position is being set to the value of the first or something?\n\nWait, in the first input row of example 0, position 1 is 4, and position 4 in output is 4. So maybe position 4 is being replaced with position 1's value. Let's check that.\n\nYes, in the first input row of example 0, input[1] is 4. Output[4] is 4. So position 4 is set to position 1's value.\n\nSimilarly, in the fifth row of example 0's input: [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1]. Output becomes [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]. So position 3 is 2 (original was 1?), wait input position 3 is 1, output position 3 is 2. Where does that 2 come from? The first element is 2. So maybe in some rows, positions 3 and 4 are replaced with the first element's value. Or perhaps even positions 3 and 6?\n\nWait, looking at the output of the fifth row in example 0: [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]. Original input's position 3 was 1, changed to 2. Position 4 was 1, stays 1. Position 6 was 2 (same as input). Hmm, maybe different rules for different rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to every other row, like rows 0, 2, 4, 6. Wait, example 0's first output row is modified, but the second input row is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1], output is same. Third row is all zeros, output same. Fourth row input is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1], output becomes [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,1]. Wait, in example 0's fourth row (index 3?), input is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1], output is [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,1]. So the second element (index 1) changed from 1 to 4? But why? Maybe not. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is applied to certain rows where the first element is a certain value, or maybe every other row starting from the top. Alternatively, maybe mirroring elements. Let me check example 1.\n\nIn example 1, input's first row is [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1]. Output is same. Second input row [1,3,0,1,1,0,1,3] becomes [1,3,0,1,3,0,1,3]. So in the output, position 4 (which was 1) becomes 3. So again, maybe position 4 is set to the value of position 1. Because position 1 is 3 here. So in the second row, position 4 in output is 3. So maybe for even rows (0-based) like row 0, 2, 4, etc., or perhaps every other row, certain positions are replaced.\n\nWait, looking at example 0's first row (input row 0), output row 0: position 4 changes to 4 (value from position 1). In example 1's row 1 (input row 1), position 4 is changed to 3 (same as position 1's value 3). In example 0's fifth row (row 4, 0-based?), input [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1], output [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]. Here, position 3 (input 1) becomes 2 (same as position 0's value 2). Position 4 in input is 1, output is 1 (no change). Hmm, maybe in certain positions, the value is replaced with the first element of the row. Wait, in row 4 of example 0's input, first element is 2. Output's position 3 is 2. So maybe in even rows (like row 0, 4, etc.), positions 3 and 5 are replaced with the first element's value? Or perhaps position 3 and 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in each row, the elements at positions 3 and 4 are set to the value of the first element of the row. Let's check.\n\nExample 0, row 0: first element is 1. Original positions 3 and 4 are 1 and 1. Output positions 3 and 4 are 1 and 4. Wait, no. Hmm. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is to mirror the first half of the array. Wait, each row has 8 elements. If we split into two halves, first four and last four. Maybe mirroring elements. But looking at example 0's first input row [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4], output is [1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4]. The second half (positions 4-7) in input is [1,0,1,4]. Output's second half is [4,0,1,4]. So position 4 is 4 (from input's position1) maybe. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for certain rows, the elements in positions 3 and 4 are being replaced. Let's take example 0:\n\nRow 0 input: [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4]. Output row0: [1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4]. So position4 changes from 1 to4. So the fifth element (0-indexed 4) is set to the value of position1 (4). Similarly, in example1's row1 input: [1,3,0,1,1,0,1,3], output [1,3,0,1,3,0,1,3]. Position4 is set to 3 (same as position1). So maybe in the rows where the first element is the same as the last element (like in row0 of example0, first element is1, last is4? No. Wait, that's not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for rows where the first element is the same as the seventh element (position6 in 0-based), but in example0's row0 input, first element is1 and seventh is1 (position6 is1), so not sure.\n\nWait, maybe look for the rows that are modified in the output. For example, in example0's output, the rows that changed are row0, row3, row4, row6. Let's check those rows.\n\nRow0 input: [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4] \u2192 output: [1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4]. So change at position4.\n\nRow3 input: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1] \u2192 output: [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,1]. Wait, in example0's output row3, the second element (position1) is changed from1 to4. But how? Where does 4 come from?\n\nWait, maybe looking for some kind of vertical propagation. For example, in example0's row0, position1 is4, which might influence row3's position1. But row3 is the fourth row (0-based index3), but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at the columns. Let's see. For example, in example0, the first column is [1,1,0,1,2,0,1,1]. The output's first column is same. The second column in input is [4,1,0,1,1,0,4,1]. Output's second column is [4,1,0,4,1,0,4,1]. So in output column1, some entries are changed to4. Like in rows0,3,6. How? Hmm, perhaps in every fourth row? Or based on some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to mirror the elements from the first half of the row. Let's see. For example, in example0's row0 input: [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4]. The first four elements are [1,4,0,1], and the next four are [1,0,1,4]. The output is [1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4]. So the fifth element (position4) becomes4, which is the second element of the first half. Then the sixth remains 0. The seventh is 1 \u2192 same as first element. Wait, perhaps the second half is modified to mirror certain elements from the first half.\n\nAnother approach: look at each example's changes.\n\nIn example0, output rows 0,3,4,6 have changes.\n\nRow0: position4 becomes4 (from position1).\n\nRow3: position1 becomes4 (from where? Maybe from row0's position1? Or maybe row3's position1 is set to the value of the first element of the row above. Let's see. Row3's input is [1,1,...], and in output, row3's position1 is4. The row above is row2 which is all zeros, so that's not. Alternatively, maybe the rows that are not all zeros (since row2 and row5 are all zeros and output same) have some transformation.\n\nIn example1's output, the rows that changed are row1 and row3 and row4.\n\nRow1 input: [1,3,0,1,1,0,1,3]. Output becomes [1,3,0,1,3,0,1,3]. So position4 becomes3 (same as position1). Also, row3's output changes. Let's see. Input row3 is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1], output becomes [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1]. Wait, no, in example1's output, row3 becomes [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1]. Original input row3 is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]. So position3 (fourth element) is changed to7. Where does 7 come from? Looking at example1's input row0, position3 is7. Maybe some vertical transfer. For example, in row3's output, position3 is set to the value of row0's position3 (7). Then in example1's row4 (input: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1], output becomes [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,3]. Wait, position7 becomes3. But where does that 3 come from? Maybe from the row above (row3) which in output is [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1], but position7 is1. Hmm, this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in each non-zero row, certain positions are replaced with the value from the same position in the first row. For example, in example1's row3, position3 is set to7, which is the same as row0's position3 (7). Similarly, in example0's row3, position1 is set to4, which matches row0's position1 (4). That could be a pattern. Let me check.\n\nIn example0:\n\nRow3 in output has position1 as4. Row0's position1 is4. So yes. Row3's position1 is set to row0's position1.\n\nRow4 in example0's output is [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]. Position3 is2 (original input was1). Row0's position3 is1. Hmm, not matching. Wait, maybe row4's position3 is set to row4's position0, which is2. So in row4's output, position3 becomes2 (same as row4's first element). Similarly, in example1's row1 output, position4 is3, same as row1's position1 (3). So perhaps in each row, positions3 and4 are replaced with the value of the first element of the row (position0) and the second element (position1), respectively.\n\nWait, let's check example0's row0:\n\nOriginal positions3 and4 are1 and1. Output positions3 and4 are1 and4. So position3 is same as input (1), but position4 is set to4 (row0's position1). So maybe position4 is set to position1's value. Similarly, in example0's row4 (input [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1], output [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]). So position3 is2 (which is row4's position0), and position4 remains1. Hmm, but in this case, position3 is set to position0's value. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in even rows (0-based), position4 is set to position1's value, and in odd rows, position3 is set to position0's value? Or something like that.\n\nLooking at example1's row1 (input [1,3,0,1,1,0,1,3], output [1,3,0,1,3,0,1,3]). So position4 becomes3 (row1's position1). So that's similar to example0's row0 and row4. So perhaps in all non-zero rows, the fifth element (position4) is set to the value of the second element (position1) of that row. Let's test this.\n\nIn example0's row0: yes, position4 becomes4 (position1 is4).\n\nIn example0's row4: position1 is1, position4 is1 (so no change). Wait, but in example0's row4 output, position3 is2 (original was1), which is row4's position0 (2). So maybe for certain rows, both position3 and 4 are modified. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe position4 is set to position1, and position6 is set to position0. Let's check example0's row0 output: position6 is1 (same as input, position0 is1). No change. But in example0's row4 output, position6 is2 (position0 is2). So yes, position6 is set to position0. Wait, original input for row4: position6 is2 (same as position0). So maybe in some cases, position6 is already equal to position0. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nLet me check example1's row4. Input is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1], output becomes [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,3]. So position7 (last element) becomes3. Where does 3 come from? Maybe from the previous row (row3's output, which has position7 as1). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a diagonal thing. For example, in example0's row3, position1 is4, which matches row0's position1. Then in example1's row3, position3 is7, which matches row0's position3. So maybe for rows that are not all zeros, certain positions are replaced with the value from the same position in the first non-zero row above them. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern involves mirroring the first four elements into the last four, but with some modification. For example, the first four elements are copied into the last four, but with the 3rd and 4th elements (indices3 and4) possibly replaced.\n\nIn example0's row0 input: first four [1,4,0,1], last four [1,0,1,4]. Output's last four are [4,0,1,4]. So the fifth element (position4) is4 instead of1. So maybe position4 is set to position1, and other positions stay the same.\n\nAnother observation: in all output rows, whenever there's a 0 in the input, it's preserved. So the zeros are not changed. So the transformation only affects non-zero elements.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n[1, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[6, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 6, 1]\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8]\n\nApplying the possible pattern where in each non-zero row, position4 (fifth element) is set to position1's value, and position3 (fourth element) is set to position0's value.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nFor example, take the first row of the test input: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]. If we set position3 to position0 (1) and position4 to position1 (1), which are already the case. So no change. So output first row same as input.\n\nSecond row: [1,8,0,1,1,0,1,8]. Position3 would be set to1 (position0), which is already 1. Position4 would be set to8 (position1). So output becomes [1,8,0,1,8,0,1,8]. \n\nFourth row (third non-zero row): [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]. Position3 and 4 are already 1 and 1. So no change.\n\nFifth row (fourth non-zero row): [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]. Similarly, no change.\n\nSeventh row (sixth non-zero): [6,1,0,1,1,0,6,1]. Position3 (1) set to6 (position0), position4 (1) set to1 (position1). So output becomes [6,1,0,6,1,0,6,1].\n\nEighth row (seventh non-zero): [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,8]. Position3 set to1, position4 to1. So no change except maybe position7? But according to previous examples, maybe only positions3 and4 are modified. \n\nBut wait, in example1's output row4, the last element is3. How did that happen? Original input's row4 is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1], output becomes [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,3]. So position7 is set to3. Where does that come from? Hmm. Maybe in that case, position7 is set to the same value as the row above's position7. Let's see. The row above (row3 in example1's output) is [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1]. So position7 is1. But output row4's position7 is3, which matches the previous row (row1) in example1's output, which has position7 as3. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe position7 is set to position1's value. For example, in example1's row4 output, position7 is3, which is the same as row1's position1 (3). But how is that connected? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different pattern. Let's look at the test input and expected changes.\n\nTest Input row2 is all zeros, same as training examples. So output remains the same.\n\nTest row7 is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,8]. If following the same pattern as example0's row0, then position4 (1) would be set to position1's value (1), so no change. Position3 (1) set to position0 (1). So no change. But the last element is8. Maybe that's not part of the pattern.\n\nBut in example0's first row, the last element is4, which is same as position1. So perhaps in the output, position7 is set to position1's value. Let's check.\n\nIn example0's row0 input, position7 is4 (same as position1). So no change. Output is same. In example0's row4, input's position7 is1. Output is1. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row, the elements at positions3,4,6,7 are set to position0, position1, position0, position1, respectively.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nFor example, example0's row0:\n\nOriginal: [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4]\n\nIf positions3=0,4=1,6=0,7=1 \u2192 no. Wait, the proposed pattern would set:\n\nposition3 to position0 (1), position4 to position1 (4), position6 to position0 (1), position7 to position1 (4). Which matches the output [1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4]. Yes, this fits.\n\nAnother example: example0's row4 input [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1]. Applying the pattern:\n\nposition3=2 (position0), position4=1 (position1), position6=2 (position0), position7=1 (position1). So output would be [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1], which matches the actual output.\n\nExample1's row1 input [1,3,0,1,1,0,1,3]. Applying pattern:\n\nposition3=1, position4=3, position6=1, position7=3. Output becomes [1,3,0,1,3,0,1,3], which matches.\n\nExample1's row4 input [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]. Applying pattern:\n\npositions3=1,4=1,6=1,7=1. Output is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]. But in example1's output, row4 is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,3]. Wait, this doesn't fit. So maybe this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, example1's row4 output is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,3]. So position7 is3. According to the previous pattern, position7 should be position1 (1). So this contradicts.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is not exactly that, but perhaps only positions3 and4 are modified.\n\nLooking at example1's row4 output: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,3]. The last element is3. So maybe in certain cases, the last element is changed to the same as position1 of the row. But in this case, position1 is1. So it's 3, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last element is set to the same as position1 of the first row. In example1's first row (row0) position1 is1. So why would row4's last element be3? This is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that in each row, positions3 and4 are set to position0 and position1, respectively. And positions6 and7 are set to position0 and position1 again.\n\nSo for example0's row0:\n\npositions3=0 \u21921, position4=1 \u21924 (position1). Positions6=0 \u21921 (position0), position7=4 \u21924 (position1). So output would have positions3=1,4=4,6=1,7=4. Which matches the output.\n\nExample0's row4 input [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1]. Applying this:\n\nposition3=2 (position0), position4=1 (position1), position6=2 (position0), position7=1 (position1). So output becomes [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1], which matches.\n\nExample1's row1 input [1,3,0,1,1,0,1,3]. Applying this:\n\npositions3=1,4=3,6=1,7=3. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1's row4 input [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]. Output is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,3]. Hmm, position7 is3. This doesn't fit. Unless there's another rule for certain rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern applies only to certain rows, like rows that are not all-zero and have a certain condition. For example, rows where the first and last elements are the same. Let's check.\n\nIn example0's row0 input: first is1, last is4. Not same. But output's last element is4 (same as position1). So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that in every row (excluding all-zero rows), the elements in positions3 and4 are set to the row's position0 and position1, respectively. And elements in positions6 and7 are also set to position0 and position1.\n\nSo for any non-zero row:\n\noutput[3] = input[0]\n\noutput[4] = input[1]\n\noutput[6] = input[0]\n\noutput[7] = input[1]\n\nLet's test this with example0's row0:\n\ninput[0]=1, input[1]=4.\n\noutput[3]=1, output[4]=4, output[6]=1, output[7]=4. Which matches the output.\n\nExample0's row4 input: [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1].\n\noutput[3]=2 (input[0]), output[4]=1 (input[1]), output[6]=2, output[7]=1. Which matches.\n\nExample1's row1: input[0]=1, input[1]=3.\n\noutput[3]=1, output[4]=3, output[6]=1, output[7]=3. Which matches.\n\nExample1's row4 input: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]. Applying the pattern:\n\noutput[3]=1, output[4]=1, output[6]=1, output[7]=1. So output should be same as input. But in example1's output, row4 is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,3]. So position7 is3. This contradicts. So this pattern doesn't hold for all cases.\n\nAh, but wait in example1's row4 output, the input may have been modified in another row. Let's check the input of example1's row4. Input is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]. Output is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,3]. So position7 is3. Where does that 3 come from? Maybe from another row's position1. Looking at example1's row1 (output) has position1=3, and row7's input is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,3]. So perhaps the last element of row4 is set to the same as the last element of the previous row. But row3's output is [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1], which has last element1. So that doesn't explain it.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the pattern is that in each non-zero row, the elements at positions3 and4 are set to the row's first element and second element respectively, but only if they are not zero. Or perhaps the rule applies to all non-zero rows except those where certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the training examples, perhaps the transformation is to replace positions3 and4 in even-numbered rows (0-based) with the first and second elements, and in odd-numbered rows, positions6 and7 are replaced with the first and second elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that in each row, the fourth and fifth elements (indices3 and4) are replaced with the first and second elements of the row. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row0: [1,4,0,1,1,...] \u2192 output becomes [1,4,0,1,4,...]. So position3=1 (same as input[0]), position4=4 (input[1]). Yes.\n\nExample0's row4: [2,1,0,1,1,...] \u2192 output becomes [2,1,0,2,1,...]. Position3=2 (input[0]), position4=1 (input[1]). Yes.\n\nExample1's row1: [1,3,0,1,1,...] \u2192 output [1,3,0,1,3,...]. Position3=1 (input[0]), position4=3 (input[1]). Yes.\n\nExample1's row3: [1,1,0,1,1,...] becomes [1,1,0,7,1,...]. Wait, in example1's output row3, position3 is7. But according to this pattern, it should be input[0] of that row, which is1. So this contradicts. So the pattern doesn't hold here.\n\nBut in example1's row3 input is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1], output is [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1]. Position3 is7. So how does that fit? Where does7 come from? Looking at example1's input row0 is [1,1,0,7,1,0,1,1]. So row0's position3 is7. So maybe in example1's output row3, position3 is set to row0's position3. That's possible. So the pattern might involve copying values from other rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace positions3 and4 in each row with the values from positions0 and1 of the first row. For example, in example0's row0, positions3 and4 are1 and4 (which are positions0 and1 of row0). In example0's row3, positions3 and4 become1 and1 (but output row3 has position1=4, which is from row0's position1). Not sure.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, some rows have elements that match the first row's elements. For example, in example0's output row3, position1 is4, same as row0's position1. In example1's output row3, position3 is7, same as row0's position3. So maybe the transformation is: for each row, if the row index is divisible by 4 (i.e., rows 0,4), then apply certain changes. Or perhaps, for each group of four rows, apply the first row's values to certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves changing certain positions in every other row. For example, rows 0,4, etc., have their positions3 and4 updated.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to apply the initial hypothesis to the test input.\n\nAssuming that in each non-zero row, positions3 and4 are replaced with the row's first and second elements (positions0 and1). Also, positions6 and7 are replaced with positions0 and1.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nApplying the transformation: positions3=1 (row0's 0), position4=1 (row0's1), positions6=1,7=1. So no change.\n\nRow1: [1,8,0,1,1,0,1,8]\n\nAfter transformation: positions3=1,4=8,6=1,7=8 \u2192 new row: [1,8,0,1,8,0,1,8].\n\nRow2: all zeros \u2192 unchanged.\n\nRow3: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1] \u2192 same as row0, so no change.\n\nRow4: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1] \u2192 positions3=1,4=1,6=1,7=1 \u2192 no change.\n\nRow5: zeros \u2192 unchanged.\n\nRow6: [6,1,0,1,1,0,6,1] \u2192 applying transformation: positions3=6,4=1,6=6,7=1. So new row: [6,1,0,6,1,0,6,1].\n\nRow7: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,8] \u2192 positions3=1,4=1,6=1,7=1 \u2192 new row: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]. But original last element is8, but according to transformation, it should become1. But looking at the training examples, in example1's row4 output, position7 is3. If that's not following this pattern, then this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation only affects positions3 and4, and leaves positions6 and7 as they are. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's row0: positions3=1 (0),4=4 (1). Positions6 and7 remain same as input. So output row0: [1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4]. Input's positions6 and7 were1 and4. Output's positions6 is1 (same),7 is4 (same as input). So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's row1: positions3=1,4=3. Positions6 and7 become1 and3. So output is [1,3,0,1,3,0,1,3]. Input's positions6 and7 were1 and3. So yes, in this case, they are same as input. So perhaps positions6 and7 are not changed. But in example0's row4 input, positions6 and7 were2 and1. Output is [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]. So positions6 and7 are set to2 and1. Which are position0 and1. So that's conflicting.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that for each non-zero row:\n\npositions3 = position0\n\nposition4 = position1\n\npositions6 = position0\n\nposition7 = position1\n\nSo replacing positions3,4,6,7 with 0,1,0,1 values.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]. Positions3=1,4=1,6=1,7=1 \u2192 same as input. No change.\n\nRow1: [1,8,0,1,1,0,1,8] \u2192 becomes [1,8,0,1,8,0,1,8].\n\nRow3: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1] \u2192 no change.\n\nRow4: same as row0 \u2192 no change.\n\nRow6: [6,1,0,1,1,0,6,1] \u2192 becomes [6,1,0,6,1,0,6,1].\n\nRow7: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,8] \u2192 becomes [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1].\n\nBut in example1's row4 output, the last element is3. So this contradicts. So why is that? Maybe there's an exception when position1 in the row is the same as some other value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is applied only to every other non-zero row, starting from row0.\n\nBut in example0's row0, row3, row4, row6 are modified. That's not every other row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows where the first element is different from the seventh. For example, in example0's row0 input, first is1, seventh is4 (different), so transformation is applied. In row4 input, first is2, seventh is1 (different), so applied. In example1's row1 input, first is1, seventh is3 (different), applied. In example1's row4 input, first is1, seventh is1 (same), so not applied. But in example1's output row4, the seventh element is3, which is different. So maybe even if the seventh element is same as first, the transformation is applied. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I have, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that positions3,4,6,7 are replaced with the first and second elements of the row, and apply it to the test input.\n\nTest input row1 becomes [1,8,0,1,8,0,1,8].\n\nRow6 becomes [6,1,0,6,1,0,6,1].\n\nRow7 becomes [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1].\n\nOther rows remain same.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\n[1,8,0,1,8,0,1,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[6,1,0,6,1,0,6,1]\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nBut looking at example1's row4 output, which is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,3], this doesn't fit the pattern. So maybe there's another rule. But given the training examples, perhaps the correct pattern is to set positions3 and4 to the first and second elements of the row. And in the test input, the rows that have non-zero elements will have these positions updated.\n\nSo the final answer should follow this pattern.",
