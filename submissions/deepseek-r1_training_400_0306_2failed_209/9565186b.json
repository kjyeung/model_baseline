        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing each example carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[2, 2, 2]\n[2, 1, 8]\n[2, 8, 8]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 2, 2]\n[2, 5, 5]\n[2, 5, 5]\n\nHmm. The first row remains the same. The second row starts with 2, then 1 and 8 become 5,5. The third row was 2,8,8 and becomes 2,5,5. Wait, the third row's first element is 2 in the input, but in the output, it's 2 followed by two 5s. Wait no, the third row in input is [2,8,8], output is [2,5,5]. So maybe the 8s are turning into 5s. But the first row's elements are all 2s and stay the same. The middle row's 1 and 8 become 5. So maybe there's a rule where certain numbers are replaced with 5, but the edges depend on something else.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[1, 1, 1]\n[8, 1, 3]\n[8, 2, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[1,1,1]\n[5,1,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nFirst row stays the same. Second row: 8 becomes 5, 1 stays, 3 becomes 5. Third row: 8 and 2s become 5s. So maybe numbers that are not the same as the first row's value get turned into 5. Wait the first row is all 1s. In the second row, 8 and 3 are not 1, so they become 5, and the 1 stays. Third row: all elements are 8 and 2, which are not 1, so all become 5. That makes sense.\n\nBut Example 0's first row is all 2s. The second row has 2,1,8. The 1 and 8 are not 2, so they become 5. The third row's 8s are not 2, so they become 5. So the first row defines the 'anchor' value. All elements in subsequent rows that are not equal to the first row's value (the first element of the first row, perhaps) get replaced with 5. But let's check other examples.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n[2,2,2]\n[8,8,2]\n[2,2,2]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[5,5,2]\n[2,2,2]\n\nFirst row is 2s. Second row: 8,8,2. The first two 8s are not 2, so become 5. The 2 stays. Third row is all 2s, so remains. So that fits.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n[3,3,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[4,4,4]\n[5,5,5]\n\nWait, here the first row is [3,3,8]. The output is all 5s. Hmm. That's different. The first row's elements are 3,3,8. But the output is 5s. So maybe the pattern isn't as straightforward as the first row being the anchor. Let me think again.\n\nWait in Example 3, the output first row is all 5s. The input first row is [3,3,8]. So maybe the first row isn't the anchor here. Let me check the output. The second row in the output is [4,4,4], which matches the input's second row. So the second row in the input is all 4s, so it's kept the same. The third row in input is [8,1,1], which in the output becomes all 5s. So perhaps there's a different rule here. Maybe rows that are all the same number are kept, and others are transformed into 5s. Let's check.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input:\n\nFirst row: [3,3,8] \u2192 not all same \u2192 becomes all 5s.\n\nSecond row: [4,4,4] \u2192 all same \u2192 kept.\n\nThird row: [8,1,1] \u2192 not all same \u2192 becomes all 5s.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the first row is all 2s, so it's kept. The second row has elements 2,1,8 \u2192 not all same. So in the output, the first element is 2 (same as the first row's value?), then the rest 5s. Wait no, in the output of Example 0's second row, it's [2,5,5]. So the first element is kept as 2, others replaced with 5. So maybe the first element of each row is kept if it matches the first row's first element, and the rest are replaced with 5 if they don't match. But that might not fit.\n\nWait, let's look again at Example 0's input:\n\nFirst row: [2,2,2] \u2192 output same.\n\nSecond row: [2,1,8] \u2192 output [2,5,5]. So first element is 2 (matches first row's first element) so kept. The rest (1,8) are not 2, so 5s.\n\nThird row: [2,8,8] \u2192 output [2,5,5]. First element is 2 (matches), others 8\u21925.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each row after the first, the first element is kept if it matches the first element of the first row. The other elements in the row are replaced with 5 if they don't match the first row's first element. But wait in Example 1:\n\nFirst row's first element is 1. Second row's first element is 8 \u2192 which doesn't match 1. So in the output of Example 1's second row, the first element becomes 5. But in the output, the second row is [5,1,5]. So the first element (8 in input) becomes 5. The second element (1) matches the first row's first element (1), so kept. Third element (3) becomes 5. So perhaps, for each row, if the row is not all the same, then each element in that row is checked: if it matches the first element of the first row, keep it, else replace with 5. But the first row itself is kept as is.\n\nWait Example 3:\n\nInput first row is [3,3,8]. So first element is 3. The output for the first row is all 5s. So that contradicts the earlier idea, because the first row is not all same. But according to the previous examples, the first row is kept only if all elements are the same, otherwise, maybe it's replaced with 5s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 3's input, the first row isn't all the same (3,3,8), so the output first row is all 5s. The second row in the input is all 4s, so kept. Third row isn't all same, so becomes all 5s.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is:\n\n- For each row:\n\n   - If all elements in the row are the same, keep the row as is.\n\n   - Otherwise, replace each element with 5 if it's not the same as the first element of the entire matrix (the first element of the first row), but wait in Example 0, the entire matrix's first element is 2. So in rows that are not uniform, elements that are 2 are kept, others become 5. Let's check:\n\nExample 0:\n\nFirst row: all 2s \u2192 kept.\n\nSecond row: [2,1,8] \u2192 2 (matches first element) kept, others become 5 \u2192 [2,5,5]\n\nThird row: [2,8,8] \u2192 2 kept, 8s become 5 \u2192 [2,5,5]\n\nYes, that works.\n\nExample 1:\n\nFirst row is all 1s \u2192 kept.\n\nSecond row: [8,1,3]. First element 8 \u2260 1 \u2192 becomes 5. 1 stays, 3 becomes 5 \u2192 [5,1,5]\n\nThird row: [8,2,2]. All elements are not 1 \u2192 all become 5 \u2192 [5,5,5]\n\nExample 2:\n\nFirst row all 2s \u2192 kept.\n\nSecond row: [8,8,2]. 8\u22602 \u2192 becomes 5. 8 becomes 5, 2 stays. So [5,5,2]\n\nThird row all 2s \u2192 kept.\n\nWait, but the output in Example 2's third row is [2,2,2], which matches input.\n\nWait, but according to the rule, rows that are all same are kept. So in Example 3, the first row isn't all same, so replace each element with 5 if it's not equal to the first element of the entire matrix. Wait the first element of the entire matrix in Example 3 is 3. So in the first row, elements 3,3,8. The first element is 3. So the first two elements are 3 (same as first element), so they would stay, the 8 becomes 5. But the output is all 5s. So this contradicts that idea.\n\nWait in Example 3, the output first row is [5,5,5], even though the first two elements are 3. So maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe rows that are not all the same are replaced with 5s. But in Example 0, the second and third rows are not all same, but their output is [2,5,5] and [2,5,5]. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire matrix's first element is the key. For all cells except those in the first row, if the cell's value is equal to the first element of the matrix, then it's kept. Otherwise, replaced with 5. But how about the first row?\n\nWait in Example 3, the first element is 3. The first row's elements are 3,3,8. If the first row's elements are kept as 3 only if they equal 3 (the first element), but 8 is replaced with 5. So the first row would become [3,3,5]. But the output is all 5s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's re-examine Example 3:\n\nInput:\n[3,3,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[4,4,4]\n[5,5,5]\n\nThe second row is all 4s, so kept. The first and third rows are not uniform, so transformed. The first row becomes all 5s. Third row becomes all 5s. So perhaps, for rows that are not all the same, each element in that row is replaced with 5 if it's not equal to the first element of its own row. Wait let's see:\n\nFor Example 0's second row [2,1,8]. The first element is 2. So elements equal to 2 are kept, others become 5. So output would be [2,5,5]. That works.\n\nThird row in Example 0: [2,8,8]. First element is 2. So elements equal to 2 stay (only the first), others become 5. So output [2,5,5]. Correct.\n\nExample 1's second row: [8,1,3]. First element is 8. So elements equal to 8 stay. But in output, it's [5,1,5]. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because in output, the first element is 5, not 8. So maybe my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's look again. In Example 1, the output for the second row is [5,1,5]. The input second row is [8,1,3]. So the first element 8 is replaced with 5, 1 remains, 3 becomes 5. So this can't be based on the row's first element.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the first element of each row is compared to the first element of the first row of the matrix. If they match, they stay; otherwise, they become 5. Then, for the remaining elements in the row, if they match the first element of the matrix, they stay; else 5.\n\nLet me test this.\n\nMatrix first element is the first element of the first row. Let's call it 'key'.\n\nFor each row:\n\n- The first element: if equal to key, keep. Else, replace with 5.\n\n- The other elements in the row: if equal to key, keep. Else, replace with 5.\n\nBut how does this fit?\n\nExample 0:\n\nKey is 2.\n\nFirst row is all 2s \u2192 output same.\n\nSecond row's first element is 2 (matches key), so kept. Other elements: 1 and 8 \u2192 not 2 \u2192 replaced with 5. So [2,5,5]. Correct.\n\nThird row's first element is 2 \u2192 kept. Others 8\u21925. Correct.\n\nExample 1:\n\nKey is 1.\n\nFirst row: all 1s \u2192 output same.\n\nSecond row's first element is 8 (\u22601) \u2192 becomes 5. Other elements: 1 and 3. 1 matches key \u2192 kept. 3 \u21925. So [5,1,5]. Correct.\n\nThird row's first element is 8\u21925. Other elements 2 and 2 \u2192 not 1 \u21925. So [5,5,5]. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nKey is 2.\n\nSecond row's first element is 8\u21925. Other elements: 8 and 2. 8\u21925, 2\u21922. So output [5,5,2]. Correct.\n\nThird row's first element is 2 \u2192 kept. Others are 2s \u2192 kept. So entire row stays. Correct.\n\nExample 3:\n\nKey is 3 (first element of first row).\n\nFirst row's elements: 3,3,8. The first element is 3 (key). So first element stays. The other elements: 3 is key \u2192 stays. 8 is not \u2192 becomes 5. So first row should be [3,3,5], but the output is [5,5,5]. So this contradicts. Hmm.\n\nWait in Example 3's output, the first row is all 5s. But according to this rule, the first row's first element is 3 (key) so stays. The second element is 3 (key) stays. Third is 8\u21925. So output should be [3,3,5]. But actual output is [5,5,5]. So this rule is not correct.\n\nSo what's different in Example 3? The first row isn't all same. But why is the entire row replaced with 5s?\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the key is not the first element of the matrix, but the value of the entire first row if all elements are the same. If the first row is not uniform, then the key is 5? Or perhaps the key is the first element of the first row only if the first row is uniform. Otherwise, the key is 5.\n\nWait let's check:\n\nExample 0's first row is uniform (all 2s). So key is 2. Rows after that: first element checked against key. Others checked against key. So as before.\n\nExample 1's first row is all 1s \u2192 key is 1. Rows after that handled accordingly.\n\nExample 3's first row is not uniform. So key is 5. Then, for all rows, elements not equal to 5 would be replaced with 5. Wait but in Example 3's output, the second row is [4,4,4], which is kept. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, another possibility: If the first row is uniform, then the key is its value, and other rows are processed based on that key. If the first row is not uniform, then all rows except those that are uniform are replaced with 5s.\n\nBut in Example 3, the first row isn't uniform. The output is all 5s for first and third rows, and the second row is uniform (all 4s) so kept.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- For the entire matrix:\n\n   - Check if the first row is uniform (all elements same). \n\n   - If yes:\n\n      - For each subsequent row:\n\n         - The first element is kept if it matches the first row's value. Otherwise, replaced with 5.\n\n         - The other elements are replaced with 5 if they don't match the first row's value.\n\n   - If the first row is not uniform:\n\n      - All rows that are not uniform are replaced with all 5s.\n\n      - Rows that are uniform are kept as is.\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nExample 3's first row is not uniform. So, any row that's not uniform becomes all 5s. The second row is [4,4,4] \u2192 uniform \u2192 kept. First and third rows are not uniform \u2192 replaced with 5s. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 0's first row is uniform (all 2s). So process other rows:\n\nSecond row [2,1,8]. First element 2 (matches key) \u2192 kept. Others replaced with 5 if not 2. So [2,5,5]. Third row [2,8,8]. First element 2 \u2192 kept. Others 8\u21925. Correct.\n\nExample 1's first row is uniform (1s). Second row [8,1,3]. First element 8 \u2192 not 1 \u21925. Others 1 stays, 3\u21925 \u2192 [5,1,5]. Third row [8,2,2] \u2192 first element 8 \u21925. Others 2\u21925 (since not 1). So [5,5,5]. Correct.\n\nExample 2's first row is uniform (2s). Second row [8,8,2]. First element 8\u21925. Others: 8\u21925, 2 stays. So [5,5,2]. Third row is uniform \u2192 kept. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- If the first row is uniform (all elements the same), then:\n\n   - For each row after the first:\n\n      - The first element is kept if it matches the first row's value; otherwise, replaced with 5.\n\n      - The other elements in the row are replaced with 5 if they don't match the first row's value.\n\n   - The first row remains unchanged.\n\n- If the first row is not uniform, then:\n\n   - For each row in the matrix:\n\n      - If the row is uniform (all elements the same), leave it as is.\n\n      - If the row is not uniform, replace all elements with 5.\n\nSo applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,3,2]\n\n[3,3,2]\n\n[1,3,2]\n\nFirst row is [1,3,2] \u2192 not uniform. So according to the second part of the pattern.\n\nCheck each row:\n\nFirst row: not uniform \u2192 replaced with [5,5,5].\n\nSecond row: [3,3,2]. Check if uniform. Not uniform (3,3,2) \u2192 replace with [5,5,5].\n\nThird row: [1,3,2] \u2192 not uniform \u2192 replaced with [5,5,5].\n\nWait but looking at the output of Example 3, when the first row is not uniform, all non-uniform rows become 5s, and uniform rows are kept. So in the test input, all rows are non-uniform except possibly the second row. Wait the second row is [3,3,2]. Not uniform. Third row [1,3,2] \u2192 not uniform. So all rows are non-uniform except none. So all rows would become 5s.\n\nBut wait the test input's second row is [3,3,2]. Are the elements all the same? No, third element is 2. So all rows are non-uniform. So the output would be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut wait, let's check Example 3 again. The first row is not uniform, so any row that's uniform is kept. The second row in Example 3 is uniform, so kept. So in the test input, if any row is uniform, it's kept. Let's check the test input rows:\n\nFirst row: [1,3,2] \u2192 not uniform.\n\nSecond row: [3,3,2] \u2192 elements are 3,3,2. Not uniform.\n\nThird row: [1,3,2] \u2192 same as first row \u2192 not uniform.\n\nSo all rows are non-uniform. Therefore, according to the pattern, all should be replaced with 5s. So the output would be three rows of [5,5,5].\n\nBut wait in the training examples, when the first row is not uniform, the output's first row is all 5s, and other rows are 5s if not uniform. So the test input's output would be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut let's make sure. For instance, in Example 3, the first row is not uniform \u2192 replaced with 5s. The second row is uniform \u2192 kept. Third row not uniform \u2192 replaced with 5s. So in test input, since all rows are not uniform, all are replaced with 5s. So the output should be three rows of 5s.\n\nBut let's check another angle. Wait the test input's first row is [1,3,2], which is not uniform, so first row becomes [5,5,5]. The other rows:\n\nSecond row: [3,3,2] \u2192 not uniform \u2192 replaced with 5s. Third row: [1,3,2] \u2192 same as first \u2192 replaced with 5s. So output is three rows of [5,5,5].\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, the output is presented as lists in square brackets. So the correct answer would be three [5,5,5] rows.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output ones. Let me look at the training examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows: [2,2,2], [2,1,8], [2,8,8]. The output is [2,2,2], [2,5,5], [2,5,5]. Hmm. I notice that the first row remains the same. In the second row, the first element is 2, same as input. The 1 and 8 become 5. The third row starts with 2, but 8 and 8 become 5s. Maybe something to do with the middle element or surrounding elements?\n\nExample 1: Input rows [1,1,1], [8,1,3], [8,2,2]. Output is [1,1,1], [5,1,5], [5,5,5]. The first row stays. Second row's 8 becomes 5, 1 stays, 3 becomes 5. Third row all becomes 5s. Interesting. So maybe if there's a 1 in the middle of the second row, the first and third elements turn to 5. But not sure yet.\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input is [2,2,2], [8,8,2], [2,2,2]. Output is the same first and third rows. Second row becomes [5,5,2]. So the first two elements (8,8) turn to 5s, but the third stays 2. Maybe if the row is adjacent to a row with the same first element? Or maybe when certain numbers are next to others, they change to 5.\n\nExample 3: Input is [3,3,8], [4,4,4], [8,1,1]. Output becomes [5,5,5], [4,4,4], [5,5,5]. So the top and bottom rows become all 5s, while the middle stays. The original top row had 3,3,8. The bottom had 8,1,1. So maybe any row that's adjacent to a row with the same number in some position gets converted to 5s? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look for common patterns. The number 5 appears a lot in the outputs. Let's see when numbers change to 5. In Example 0, the middle row's 1 and 8 become 5s. The third row's 8s become 5s. But the first row remains. So maybe the rule is that any element that is not part of a \"solid\" row (all same numbers) and is adjacent (either above or below) to a solid row gets converted to 5. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 0: The first row is solid (all 2s). The middle row is [2,1,8], not solid. The elements in the middle and third positions are adjacent to the solid row below or above. Wait, the third row is [2,8,8]. Wait, no, the third row's first element is 2, same as the first row. But the third row's middle and last elements are 8. Maybe if the element is not equal to the solid row's value, it becomes 5. Let's see. The middle row in Example 0: first element is 2, same as the solid first row. So it stays 2. The other elements (1 and 8) are different, so they become 5. Third row: first element is 2 (same as solid first row), so stays 2. The other two 8s are different, so become 5. That explains Example 0's output.\n\nExample 1: First row is solid 1s. Middle row [8,1,3]. The first element 8 is different from the solid row's 1, so becomes 5. The middle element 1 matches the solid row, so stays. The third element 3 is different, becomes 5. The third row [8,2,2]. The first element 8 is different from the solid row above (which is the middle row now? Wait, no, the solid rows are the first and maybe others. Wait, maybe only the first row is solid here. Because in the input of Example1, the first row is solid 1s, the middle row isn't solid, and the third row isn't solid. So for the middle row, elements adjacent to the solid row (first row) would be the ones in the same column. So the middle row's first element (8) is in the same column as the first row's 1. Since 8 is not 1, it becomes 5. The middle element (1) is same as the solid row's (since solid row is first row, which is 1), so stays. Third element 3 is different, becomes 5. Then the third row: all elements are not in a solid row. But why do they all become 5? Because maybe if a row is between two solid rows? Wait, no. Wait in Example1, the third row is [8,2,2]. The output is [5,5,5]. But why? Let's see. The third row is below the middle row. The middle row is [8,1,3], which after transformation becomes [5,1,5]. So the third row's elements: 8 is in column 1. The solid row is first row, which is 1. So 8 is different from 1, so becomes 5. The second element 2 is different from first row's 1, becomes 5. Third element 2 is different from first row's 1, becomes 5. Hence, all 5s. So the pattern might be: for each element in non-solid rows, if the element's value is different from the first solid row's value (the first row that is all same numbers), then it becomes 5. If it's the same, it stays.\n\nWait, but in Example0, the first row is solid 2s. The middle row's first element is 2 (same as solid row), so stays. The other elements are different (1 and 8), become 5. Third row's first element is 2 (same), others are 8s (different) \u2192 become 5. That fits.\n\nExample2: Input has first and third rows as solid 2s. Middle row is [8,8,2]. Output middle row is [5,5,2]. So the first two elements are 8, which are different from the solid rows (2), so become 5. The third element is 2, same as solid rows, so stays. So this fits the hypothesis.\n\nExample3: The input's middle row is solid 4s. The first row [3,3,8] and third row [8,1,1] are not solid. The output is all 5s for first and third rows, except the middle row stays. So here, the solid row is the middle row. So for first row elements: compare to the middle solid row's 4. All elements (3,3,8) are different from 4, so become 5. Third row's elements (8,1,1) are different from 4, so become 5. So the rule seems to be: identify the solid row(s) (rows where all elements are the same), then for every other row, each element is replaced with 5 if it's different from the solid row's value; if same, remains. But which solid row? Because there could be multiple. For example, in Example0, first and third rows are solid. Wait no, in Example0's input, the third row is [2,8,8], which is not solid. Wait wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in Example0's input:\n\n[2,2,2] \u2192 solid\n[2,1,8] \u2192 not\n[2,8,8] \u2192 not, because first element is 2, others 8. So only first row is solid.\n\nBut in Example2's input, the first and third rows are both solid 2s. So the middle row's elements are compared to the solid rows. But how? Maybe when there's a solid row above and/or below, the element is compared to the closest solid row. Or perhaps, all elements in non-solid rows are compared to the value of the nearest solid row (either above or below). Wait, in Example2, the middle row is between two solid 2 rows. So any element in the middle row that's 2 remains, others become 5. So middle row [8,8,2] becomes [5,5,2]. That fits.\n\nIn Example3, the middle row is solid 4s. So the first and third rows are non-solid. Each element in those rows is compared to 4. Since none are 4, all become 5.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Identify all solid rows (rows where all elements are the same). Let's call their value S.\n\n2. For each non-solid row, each element is replaced with 5 if it's different from S. If same as S, keep it.\n\nBut how do we determine which S to use when there are multiple solid rows?\n\nIn the training examples:\n\n- Example0: Only the first row is solid (2). So middle and third rows are compared to 2.\n\n- Example1: Only the first row is solid (1). Middle and third rows compared to 1.\n\n- Example2: First and third rows are solid (2). The middle row is compared to 2 (so elements different become 5).\n\n- Example3: Only the middle row is solid (4). The first and third rows are compared to 4.\n\nSo, the rule is: for any non-solid row, replace each element with 5 if it's different from the value of the nearest solid row (either above or below). If there are multiple solid rows (like in Example2 where both first and third are solid), then compare to the solid value (since both are the same). If the non-solid row is between two solid rows with the same value, then same as before. If between two different solid rows, perhaps use the closest one? But in the examples, when there are multiple solid rows, they all have the same value.\n\nWait, looking at Example2's input:\n\nFirst row: [2,2,2] (solid 2)\nThird row: [2,2,2] (solid 2)\nMiddle row: [8,8,2]\nSo the solid rows are both 2. So elements in the middle row that are 2 stay, others become 5. Hence output [5,5,2].\n\nSo the rule could be: find all solid rows. If there's at least one solid row, take their common value (assuming all solid rows have the same value). Then, for all non-solid rows, replace elements not equal to that value with 5. But in all the training examples, all solid rows (when there are multiple) have the same value. Let me check:\n\nExample3's output: The middle row is solid 4. First and third rows are non-solid and transformed to 5s. So their elements compared to 4.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1,3,2]\n[3,3,2]\n[1,3,2]\n\nSo the input rows are:\n\nRow0: [1,3,2] \u2192 not solid (elements 1,3,2 are different)\nRow1: [3,3,2] \u2192 not solid (elements 3,3,2)\nRow2: [1,3,2] \u2192 same as row0, not solid.\n\nWait, so none of the rows are solid. Hmm. But according to the training examples, what happens in such a case? The training examples all have at least one solid row in the input. So how does the pattern apply here?\n\nWait, in the test input, there are no solid rows. So according to the previous rules, there's no S to compare. But this is the test case, so perhaps there's a different rule. Or maybe there's a solid row in the output.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples, perhaps when there are no solid rows in the input, the output is all 5s. But that's a guess. Let me check if there's any example where input has no solid rows.\n\nNone of the training examples have that. So perhaps the rule is different. Alternatively, maybe the solid rows can be in the output. Wait, looking at Example3's output:\n\nOutput is [5,5,5], [4,4,4], [5,5,5]. The middle row is solid 4. The input's middle row was solid 4, so it remains. So the output has the solid row.\n\nAnother possibility: the pattern is to turn non-solid rows into 5s, except when adjacent to a solid row. But that seems inconsistent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: for each cell in the grid, if the cell's value is the same as the entire row's value (if the row is solid), then leave it. Otherwise, check the cells in the same column from the nearest solid rows above and below. If any of those are different, turn into 5. Wait, this might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is such that all cells not part of a solid row are turned into 5, and the solid rows remain. But in Example0, the first row is solid and remains. The other rows are transformed into rows that have some 5s. Wait, in Example0's output, the first row remains, the second becomes [2,5,5], which isn't solid. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. The key seems to be that the solid rows in the input are preserved, and other rows have elements changed to 5 unless they match the solid row's value. So the steps might be:\n\n1. Identify all solid rows in the input. Let S be the value of the first solid row (assuming all solid rows have the same value). If there are multiple solid rows with different values, perhaps they are considered as S. But in the training examples, when there are multiple solid rows, they have the same value.\n\n2. For each row that is not solid, replace each element with 5 if it's different from S. If same as S, leave it.\n\nBut in Example3, the input's middle row is solid 4, so S is 4. So first and third rows are non-solid, their elements are compared to 4. All elements in those rows are not 4, so become 5. Hence the output.\n\nIn the test case, if there are no solid rows in the input, then S is undefined. But according to the examples, the test input must have a solid row. Wait the test input is:\n\n[1,3,2]\n[3,3,2]\n[1,3,2]\n\nNone of these rows are solid. Row1 has two 3s and a 2. So no solid rows. So how would the pattern apply here? There's no example in training where input has no solid rows. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output forms solid rows. Wait, looking at the outputs:\n\nIn Example0's output: first row remains solid. The other two rows are [2,5,5] and [2,5,5]. The second and third rows start with 2, then 5s. Not solid.\n\nIn Example1's output: first row solid, second row [5,1,5], third row all 5s. So third row is solid.\n\nIn Example2's output: first and third rows solid, middle row [5,5,2].\n\nIn Example3's output: middle row solid, first and third rows are all 5s (solid 5s).\n\nSo perhaps the output's solid rows are either the original solid rows or rows that become all 5s. But how does that help?\n\nWait, maybe the output is such that any row that is adjacent to a solid row (in the input) gets transformed into a row where elements that match the solid row's value stay, others become 5. And any row not adjacent to a solid row becomes all 5s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to turn any non-solid row into a row where elements that are equal to the value of the nearest solid row (above or below) remain, others become 5. If a row is between two solid rows with different values, perhaps the rule is different, but in the examples, all solid rows have the same value.\n\nBut in the test case, there are no solid rows. So how to apply the pattern here. Maybe if there are no solid rows in the input, then all elements become 5. But that's a guess. However, looking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [1,3,2]\n\nRow1: [3,3,2]\n\nRow2: [1,3,2]\n\nNone are solid. So according to this guess, the output would be all 5s. But let's see if that's possible.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when there are no solid rows, perhaps a new solid row is created. But that's not in the examples. Alternatively, maybe the middle row (row1) in the test input has two 3s and a 2. If there's a majority element (3), but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to turn the entire matrix into a specific form. But I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the solid rows in the output are those that in the input were solid, and the non-solid rows in the input are converted to rows where the first element remains if it's same as the solid row, others become 5. Wait, no.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example3's input: the middle row is solid 4. The output's first and third rows are all 5s (solid). So perhaps when a solid row is present, the rows adjacent to it become all 5s. But in Example0's output, the middle and third rows are not all 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the corners. For example, in Example0, the first element of each row is 2, so they stay, others become 5. But in Example1's output, the middle row's first element is 5. Wait, no. Example1's input's first row is solid 1s. The middle row's first element is 8, which becomes 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each cell, if it's the same as the cell above or below it in a solid row, it stays, else becomes 5. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Let's look at the outputs and see if there's a pattern in the 5s placement.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[2,5,5]\n\n[2,5,5]\n\nThe middle and bottom rows have 2 as the first element and 5s elsewhere. So maybe for non-solid rows, the first element is retained if it matches the solid row's value, others become 5.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\n[1,1,1]\n\n[5,1,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nThe middle row has the second element as 1 (same as solid row) and others 5. The third row is all 5s.\n\nBut why in the middle row, the second element is 1? Because in the input, the middle row's second element is 1 (same as solid row), so it stays, others become 5.\n\nAh! So perhaps the rule is:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- If the row is solid, leave it as is.\n\n- If the row is not solid, for each element in that row, if the element matches the value of the first solid row above or below (whichever is closer), then keep it, else change to 5.\n\nBut how to determine which solid row to compare to when there are multiple above or below.\n\nAlternatively, the elements in non-solid rows are compared to the value of the nearest solid row (either above or below) and if they match, remain, else become 5. If a row is between two solid rows with different values, perhaps take the one from above. But in training examples, all solid rows are the same value.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nSolid row is first row (2). The middle row (non-solid) elements are 2,1,8. The first element (2) matches solid row's value \u2192 stays. Others don't \u2192 become 5. Hence, middle row becomes [2,5,5]. The third row (non-solid) is [2,8,8]. First element matches \u2192 stays. Others \u2192 5. So output [2,5,5].\n\nExample1:\n\nSolid row is first (1). Middle row has elements 8,1,3. The middle element is 1 (matches solid) \u2192 stays. Others \u2192 5. So [5,1,5]. Third row: all elements don't match 1 \u2192 become 5s.\n\nExample2:\n\nFirst and third rows are solid 2. Middle row's elements: 8,8,2. Compare to solid rows. The first two elements are 8 (not 2) \u2192 become 5. Third element is 2 \u2192 stays. So output [5,5,2].\n\nExample3:\n\nMiddle row is solid 4. First row [3,3,8]: elements compared to 4. All are different \u2192 become 5. Third row [8,1,1]: same \u2192 all become 5.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [1,3,2] (non-solid)\n\nRow1: [3,3,2] (non-solid)\n\nRow2: [1,3,2] (non-solid)\n\nNone of the rows are solid. So there are no solid rows to compare. According to the previous examples, there must be at least one solid row to apply the pattern. But since there are none here, perhaps the entire output is all 5s. But this is not covered in the training examples, so I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in such cases, the entire matrix becomes all 5s. But let's see what the test input would look like. The test input has three rows, all non-solid. If there's no solid row, then according to the previous pattern, there's no value S to compare. Hence, all elements would become 5. So the output would be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n[5,5,5]\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut let's check if that makes sense. However, looking at the training examples, when there's no solid row in the input, but the output has solid rows. For example, in Example3's input, the middle row is solid. The output's first and third rows are all 5s (solid). So maybe when a row is not solid, but in the output, it becomes solid 5s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that all non-solid rows in the input are turned into rows where the first element is retained if it's part of a solid row (but the row itself isn't solid), and others become 5. But this is not consistent with examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to check for each cell whether it's in the same column as a cell in a solid row. If so, and if it's the same as the solid row's value, keep it; otherwise, change to 5. If there are no solid rows, then all cells become 5.\n\nIn the test input, there are no solid rows, so all cells would become 5. Hence, the output would be three rows of [5,5,5]. But let's verify with the examples.\n\nIn Example3's input, the middle row is solid 4. So for the first and third rows, each cell is compared to the 4 in their column from the middle row. Since the first row's cells are 3,3,8 (columns 1, 2, 3). The middle row's columns are all 4. So each cell in first row is compared to 4. Since they are all different, become 5. Same for third row.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: For each cell in a non-solid row, compare it to the value of the same column in the nearest solid row (either above or below). If they match, keep; else, change to 5. If there are multiple solid rows, perhaps the closest one. If no solid rows, all become 5.\n\nBut in Example0, the solid row is the first row. For the middle row, each cell is compared to the first row's corresponding column. First column is 2 (matches), so stays 2. Second column is 2 vs 1 (non-match) \u2192 5. Third column 2 vs 8 \u2192 5. So the middle row becomes [2,5,5]. Third row: first column 2 (same as first row's 2) \u2192 stays. Other columns 8 vs 2 \u2192 5. So yes.\n\nExample1: First row is solid 1. Middle row's columns: first column 8 vs 1 \u2192 5. Second column 1 vs 1 \u2192 stays. Third column 3 vs 1 \u21925. Third row's columns: 8 vs 1 \u21925, 2 vs1 \u21925, 2 vs1 \u21925. Hence all 5s.\n\nSo this rule works. Now, for the test input, since there are no solid rows, all cells become 5. So the output would be three rows of [5,5,5].\n\nBut let's check the test input again. Wait, the test input is:\n\n[1,3,2]\n\n[3,3,2]\n\n[1,3,2]\n\nNone of these rows are solid. So according to the rule, since there's no solid row, all elements become 5. So output is three [5,5,5] rows.\n\nBut another possibility is that the output forms a solid row based on some other criteria, but according to the training examples, the only way a new solid row (like 5s) is formed is when all elements are transformed to 5. For example, Example3's output has first and third rows as 5s. Example1's third row is all 5s. So if all elements in a non-solid row are changed to 5, that's a solid row.\n\nHence, the test input's output would be:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5]\n\nBut wait, the training examples never have all rows as 5s. Let me check if that's possible. In Example3's input, the middle row is solid, and the others become 5s. So their output has two rows of 5s. So the test case's output would be all 5s.\n\nBut let me look again at the test input:\n\n[1,3,2]\n\n[3,3,2]\n\n[1,3,2]\n\nAll rows are non-solid. According to the rule, since there are no solid rows, all elements become 5. So the output would be three rows of [5,5,5].\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, when a row is not adjacent to any solid row, but there's no solid row at all, then all elements become 5. So the answer should be three rows of 5s.",
