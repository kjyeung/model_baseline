        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the training examples provided. Then, apply that pattern to the test input to generate the correct output.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the training examples and identify the common transformations. Let's start with Example 0. \n\nIn Example 0's input, there are some numbers like 9,9 in row 2, 6,6 in row 3, and then 8,4 and 7,7 in rows 5 and 6. The output adds some 3s in the rows below these numbers. For instance, below the 6,6 in row 3, the output has 3,3 in row 4. Then below the 8,4 in row 5, there's 3,3 in row 7,8,9 for the same columns. Similarly, below the 7,7 in row 6, there are 3,3 in row 7. Wait, but in the output, rows 7,8,9 in columns 5-6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?) have 3s. Maybe the pattern is that whenever there are two adjacent numbers (either horizontally or vertically?), they generate a 3,3 below them?\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has 4,8 in row 1, 9,4 in row 2. Then in the output, below those, there are 3,3 in rows 3,4,5. Also, the 2,1 and 1,2 in rows 4 and 5 have 3,3 added below them in rows 6 and 7. So perhaps whenever there's a pair of numbers (adjacent), the next rows below them get 3,3 in the same columns. But how many rows? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the 6,6 in row 3 (input) has 3,3 in row 4 (output). Then the 8,4 in row 5 (input) has 3,3 in row 7,8,9. Wait, the 8 and 4 are adjacent but not the same. Hmm. So maybe it's not about the same numbers but any adjacent pair?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, row 5 has 8 and 4. But in the output, rows 7,8,9 have 3s in columns 5 and 6. So maybe the direction is that after a pair, the next three rows below get 3s? Wait, but the 6,6 in row 3 leads to 3,3 in row 4. Then the 7,7 in row 6 of input leads to 3,3 in row 7. But in the output for Example 0, the 8,4 in row5 (input) leads to 3s starting in row7, which is two rows below. Hmm, this might not be consistent.\n\nWait, let me reindex the rows. Let's assume the rows are 0-based. So in Example 0's input:\n\nRow 2: [0,9,9,0...] (maybe row index 2)\nRow 3: [0,6,6,0...]\nIn the output, row 4 (next row) has [0,3,3...]. Then the 8,4 are in row5 of input (row index 5), and in output, rows7,8,9 (indices 7,8,9) have 3s in columns5 and6. So how many rows below are added?\n\nWait, for the 9,9 in row2 input, the 3s are in row3? No, in the output for Example0, the output rows are:\n\nOriginal rows 0-1: same as input.\n\nRow2: same as input (9,9)\n\nRow3: same as input (6,6)\n\nRow4: added 3,3.\n\nSo after the pair in row2 and row3, the next row (row4) gets 3s. Then the 8,4 in row5 of input (original row5) is followed by 3s in row7,8,9. So maybe the number of 3 rows depends on something else. Alternatively, perhaps each pair in the input causes a certain number of 3s to be added below, perhaps based on the sum of the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pairs of numbers (adjacent horizontally) in the input are \"sources\" that generate 3s in the cells directly below them for a number of rows equal to the sum of the pair. For example, in Example0, the 9,9 pair sums to 18, but that's too high. Or maybe the count is based on the individual numbers. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the difference between the numbers. Wait, 9 and9 sum to 18, but that's not helpful. 6+6=12. 8+4=12. 7+7=14. Hmm, but in Example0, the 6,6 pair in row3 leads to one row of 3s (row4), the 8,4 in row5 leads to three rows (rows7,8,9). The 7,7 in row6 leads to one row (row7). Wait, maybe the count of rows is the minimum of the two numbers? For 6,6, min is 6. But that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the number of 3 rows is the sum divided by something. 9+9=18, but in example0, maybe they are adding 3s for as many rows as the lower of the two numbers. Wait, but 9 is high. Alternatively, maybe the number of 3s added is determined by the position where the pair is located. For example, if a pair is in row i, then the 3s start appearing in row i+1, and continue for a certain number of rows. But in example0, 9,9 in row2 (input) leads to 3s in row4. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input and output for example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow2 (third row) has 9,9.\n\nRow3 (fourth row) has 6,6.\n\nRow5 (sixth row) has 8,4.\n\nRow6 (seventh row) has7,7.\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow4 (fifth row) has 3,3 under the 6,6.\n\nRow7 (eighth row) under 8,4: 3,3.\n\nRow7 also has under 7,7: 3,3.\n\nThen rows8 and9 also have 3,3 under the 8,4.\n\nWait, perhaps for each pair, the number of 3 rows is determined by the sum of the pair modulo some number. Let's see:\n\nFor 9,9 sum is 18. In the output, there's no 3s under them. Wait, in example0's input, the 9,9 are in row2 and 6,6 in row3. The output for row4 (under 6,6) has 3s. So maybe the 6,6 generates 3s in the next row. But the 9,9 in row2 of input don't have 3s under them. So that theory is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only certain pairs generate 3s. Maybe pairs where the two numbers are the same. Wait, in example0, 9,9 and 6,6 are same-number pairs, and 8,4 and 7,7. But in the output, under 8,4 (which are different) there are 3s. Hmm. So that's not it.\n\nLooking at example1:\n\nInput has 4,8 in row1 (different), 9,4 in row2 (different), and 2,1 and 1,2 in rows4 and5. The output adds 3,3 under 9,4 (row3 and below?), and under 2,1 and 1,2 in rows6 and7. Wait, the 4,8 in row1 (input) don't get 3s under them. The 9,4 in row2 (input) have 3s added in row3,4,5. The 2,1 and 1,2 have 3s in rows6 and7. So perhaps the sum of the pair determines the number of 3 rows. For 9+4=13, but that's a high number, but the output has three rows (rows3,4,5) of 3s. 2+1=3, which may correspond to two rows (rows6 and7). Wait, but 3 rows? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference between the two numbers. For example, in example0, 8 and4 have a difference of4. 7 and7 have a difference of0. So for 8-4=4, perhaps 4 rows of 3s. But in example0's output, there are three rows (7,8,9) with 3s under 8,4. So that's 3 rows, not 4. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction in which the pairs are placed. For example, vertical or horizontal pairs. In example0, the pairs are horizontal (same row, adjacent columns). The 3s are added in the same columns but in the rows below. So for each horizontal pair, add 3s in the same columns below. How many rows? Let's check example0's 6,6 in row3. The output adds 3,3 in row4 (next row). Then the 8,4 in row5, which is a pair (columns5 and6), output adds 3s in rows7,8,9 (three rows below). The 7,7 in row6 adds 3s in row7 (next row). So why the difference in the number of rows added?\n\nWait, maybe the position in the grid affects how many 3s are added. For example, the 8,4 are near the bottom of the grid (row5), so there are three rows below (rows6,7,8,9) but in the output, rows7,8,9. Hmm. But the 7,7 in row6 (input) have their 3s in row7 (output). So maybe the number of rows is determined by how far down they are. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the 3s added. In example0, the output has 3s in rows4,5 (from 6,6), rows7,8,9 (from 8,4), row7 (from7,7). So for each pair in the input, the 3s start in the next row and continue for a certain number of rows. Let's see:\n\nFor 6,6 in row3 (input):\n\n3s start in row4 (output row4) and continue for 2 rows (row4 and row5). Wait, in output example0, row4 has 3,3. Then row5 (input had 8,4) but output row5 also has 3,3. Wait, but in example0's output row5 is:\n\n[0,3,3,0,0,8,4,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 3,3 are in columns1 and2, which were from the 6,6 in row3. Then row5 has 3,3 in columns1 and2 again. So that's two rows (row4 and row5) for the 6,6. Then the 8,4 in row5 of input (columns5 and6) has 3,3 in rows7,8,9. So that's three rows. The 7,7 in row6 (input) has 3,3 in row7 (output). So for each pair, the number of 3s added below may be the sum of the two numbers divided by something. 6+6=12, divided by 6 gives 2 rows. 8+4=12, divided by 4 gives 3 rows. 7+7=14, divided by 7 gives 2, but in example0, there's only one row. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of rows is determined by the smaller of the two numbers. For example, 6 and6: min is6. But 6 divided by 3 gives 2 rows. 8 and4: min is4. 4 divided by 3 (since 3 is the value in output) gives 1.333, but in the example0, there are three rows. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of 3 rows is the sum of the pair divided by 3. For 6+6=12: 12/3=4. But in example0's output, it's two rows. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 3 rows is equal to the sum of the two digits modulo 3. For 6+6=12 mod3=0, which is 0. But 12 mod3 is 0, which would mean zero rows. But there are two rows. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the 3s are added in the same columns as the original pair, but in subsequent rows, and the number of 3 rows is based on the original numbers. For example, if the pair is (a, b), then the number of 3 rows is a + b. But 6+6=12, which is way too high. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair generates 3s in the next (a + b) / 3 rows. For example, 6+6=12 \u2192 12/3=4 rows, but in example0, the 6,6 pair leads to two rows of 3s (rows4 and5). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair generates 3s for a number of rows equal to the number of unique digits in the pair. For 6,6: unique count is1 \u2192 1 row. But in example0, there are two rows (row4 and5). So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the positions of the pairs. For example, in example0, the 6,6 pair is in row3 (0-based) and the 3s start in row4. Then the 8,4 pair is in row5, and the 3s start in row7, which is two rows below. Hmm, why the gap? Or maybe the 3s are added after a certain number of rows. Not sure.\n\nLooking at example1's input and output:\n\nIn example1's input, the pair 9,4 in row2 (0-based). Output has 3,3 in row3,4,5. So three rows. The pair 2,1 and 1,2 (in rows4 and5) generate 3,3 in rows6 and7. So two rows. What's the difference here? The 9,4 sum is 13, the 2,1 sum is3. So perhaps the number of rows is the sum divided by something. 13/3 is ~4.333, but three rows. 3/3 is 1, but two rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of rows is the difference between the two numbers. 9-4=5 \u21925 rows. But in example1, the 3 rows. 2-1=1 \u21921 row, but two rows. So no.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that for each pair in the input, the 3s are added in the same columns, starting from the row below, and continuing until they hit another non-zero cell or the end of the grid. Let's check.\n\nIn example0, the 6,6 pair in row3. Below that is row4 (input row4 is all zeros). So 3s are added in row4. Then row5 (input) has 8,4 in columns5 and6. So maybe the 3s from the 6,6 stop at row4 because the next row (row5) has a non-zero entry in different columns. So the 3s are added until they hit a non-zero cell. Wait, but in example0's output, the 3s from 6,6 are in rows4 and5. Because row5's columns1 and2 are 3,3. But the original input row5 has 0s in columns1 and2. So maybe the 3s continue until they are blocked by another pair.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s propagate downward until they hit another non-zero cell, and then they stop. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, the 6,6 pair in row3. The next row (row4) is empty, so add 3,3. Then row5 (original input) has 0s in columns1 and2, so add 3,3 again. Then row6 has 0s, so add 3,3. But in the output for example0, row6 has 0s except for columns5 and6. So why do the 3s from 6,6 stop at row5? Because row5's 3,3 is part of the input's output, but in row6, the 3s from 6,6 would be in columns1 and2. However, the output for row6 is [0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0]. So no 3s in columns1 and2 here. Hmm, so that theory isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added directly below the pair for a fixed number of rows, like two rows. For example, 6,6 in row3 \u2192 add 3s in row4 and5. Then 8,4 in row5 \u2192 add 3s in rows7,8,9. How many rows? Three rows. So perhaps it's based on the row number. For example, pairs in even rows add two rows of 3s, pairs in odd rows add three. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are added in the same columns as the original pair, starting from the next row, and continuing for as long as the cells below are zero. But in example0, for the 6,6 pair in row3, the rows below are row4 (added 3s), row5 (added 3s again?), but in the output, row5 has 3s in columns1 and2. Then why does it stop there? Because in row6, the input has 7,7 in columns5 and6. So the 3s from 6,6 continue until the row where another pair exists. But that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added for a number of rows equal to the minimum of the two numbers. For example, 6 and6, min is6 \u2192 but that's more than the grid allows. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, let's consider another approach. Let's look at the output's 3s. In all examples, the 3s form vertical pairs. For example, in example0's output, the 3s are in columns1-2, rows4 and5; columns5-6, rows7,8,9. So each pair in the input generates vertical pairs of 3s in the same columns below. The number of vertical pairs added depends on something.\n\nLooking at example0's input:\n\nOriginal pairs:\n\nRow2: 9,9 (columns1-2)\n\nRow3:6,6 (columns1-2)\n\nRow5:8,4 (columns5-6)\n\nRow6:7,7 (columns5-6)\n\nIn the output:\n\nFor row2's 9,9, no 3s below.\n\nRow3's 6,6 \u2192 3s in row4 and5 (columns1-2). Then row5's 8,4 \u2192 3s in rows7,8,9 (columns5-6).\n\nRow6's7,7 \u21923s in row7 (columns5-6).\n\nBut why do the 6,6 generate two rows of 3s, the 8,4 generate three, and 7,7 generate one?\n\nAlternatively, the number of 3 rows is determined by the sum of the pair's digits divided by 3. For 6+6=12 \u2192 4, but there are two rows. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair in the input adds a vertical line of 3s, where the length of the line is determined by the sum of the pair's digits divided by 3. For example, 6+6=12 \u2192 4, but the line is two rows. Not matching.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the 3s are added in the same columns, but the number of rows is equal to the number of pairs that are adjacent in the input. For example, if two pairs are stacked vertically, they generate longer 3 lines. But in example0, the 9,9 and6,6 are in adjacent rows (row2 and3). In the output, the 3s start in row4 (below 6,6) and go for two rows. So perhaps the stacking of pairs affects the number of 3s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are added in the columns of the input pairs, starting from the row below and continuing until the end of the grid, but overwriting any existing non-zero numbers. But in example0, the 3s from the6,6 stop at row5. Because row5 has 8,4 in columns5-6, but that's different columns. So why stop there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added for a fixed number of rows, like two or three, but it's unclear why the numbers vary.\n\nLet's look at example2's input and output.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow1: [0,0,2,4,0,0,9,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,6,7,0,0,8,9,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\nRows3 and4 have 3,3 in columns2-3 and 6-7. Row5 has 3,3 in columns2-3 and 7,6 (but input row5 has 7,6). Then row6 has 3,3 in columns2-3 and 6,6. Row7 has 3,3 in columns4-5. So the pairs in the input generate 3s in the same columns below. For example, 2,4 and6,7 in rows1 and2 (columns2-3 and6-7) generate 3s in rows3-4,5,6. Then the 7,6 and6,6 in rows5 and6 (columns4-5 and5-6) generate 3s in row7 and8 (columns4-5).\n\nSo in example2, the 2,4 and6,7 pairs (different numbers) generate 3s in the same columns for three rows. The 7,6 and6,6 generate 3s for two rows.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to find a common rule that applies to all examples.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, whenever there's a pair of numbers (adjacent horizontally) in the input, the output adds vertical pairs of 3s directly below those columns. The number of rows with 3s seems to vary, but perhaps there's a rule based on the values of the pair.\n\nWait, in example0's 8,4 pair (sum 12), there are three rows of 3s. In example1's 9,4 pair (sum 13), three rows. The 2,1 pair (sum 3) gives two rows. In example2's 2,4 (sum6) gives three rows, 7,6 (sum13) gives two rows. Hmm, not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of rows is the sum of the pair modulo 3. For 8+4=12 mod3=0 \u2192 three rows (12 mod3=0, but 12/3=4, which is more than three). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows is the number of steps you can take down before hitting another non-zero cell. For example, in example0's 8,4 pair in row5:\n\nRow5's input has 8,4. The next row (row6) has7,7, which are in different columns (5-6). So the 8,4 pair in columns5-6 of row5. The row below (row6) has 7,7 in columns5-6. So the 3s for 8,4 would start in row7, and continue until row9. So three rows. Because the row below (row6) is occupied by 7,7, so they skip row6 and start at row7.\n\nSimilarly, for the 6,6 in row3 of example0:\n\nThe row below is row4 (input row4 is all zeros). So 3s start at row4. Then row5's input has 0s in those columns (columns1-2), so add 3s there. Then row6's input has 0s, so add 3s, but in the output, row6's columns1-2 are 0. Wait, why?\n\nAh, in example0's output, after the 6,6 in row3, the 3s are added in row4 and5. So why not row6? Because row5's input has 8,4 in columns5-6, but row5's output in columns1-2 is 3,3. Then row6's input has 0s in columns1-2, but in output row6's columns1-2 are 0. So the 3s stop at row5.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that for each pair in the input, you add 3s in the same columns below until you hit another pair in the same columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are added in all rows below the original pair until the end of the grid, but in the examples, some rows are left as zero. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are added for a number of rows equal to the sum of the pair divided by 3, rounded down. For example:\n\n6+6=12 \u2192 12/3=4 \u2192 4 rows, but in example0, there are two rows. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the pattern is that for each horizontal pair (a, b) in the input, the output adds 3s in the same columns for (a + b) / 3 rows. Let's test:\n\nFor example0's 6,6: (6+6)/3=4. But added two rows. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's 9,4: (9+4)/3=4.333, so 4 rows. But added three rows. No.\n\nExample2's 2,4: (6)/3=2. But added three rows. No.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 3s are added in the same columns for every pair, but the number of rows depends on the position in the grid. For example, pairs closer to the top add more rows. But in example0, the 6,6 is in row3 and adds two rows, whereas the 8,4 in row5 adds three rows. So perhaps the lower the pair, the fewer rows possible. But 8,4 is in row5 and adds three rows, which is more than the 6,6. So that's not.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 3s are added for each pair, but only if there's a certain condition. Like, the 3s are added for pairs that are part of a certain shape. But the examples don't show any obvious shapes.\n\nWait, looking at example0's output, the 3s form vertical lines. For example, the 6,6 pair in row3 leads to 3s in rows4 and5. The 8,4 in row5 leads to 3s in rows7,8,9. The 7,7 in row6 leads to 3s in row7. So the 3s are added in columns of the original pairs, and the length of the vertical lines varies.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 3s are added below each pair for a number of rows equal to the number of pairs in the same column. For example, if there are multiple pairs stacked in the same columns, they generate longer vertical lines. But in example0's 6,6 and9,9 are in columns1-2, but the 9,9 don't generate 3s. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair adds 3s below them until another pair in the same columns is encountered. For example, in example0, the 6,6 in row3 adds 3s until the next pair in columns1-2. But since there are no other pairs in those columns, the 3s continue. But in example0's output, they only continue for two rows. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 3 rows is the number of non-zero pairs in the same columns above them. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: All the 3s added are in pairs (3,3). So for each pair in the input, the output adds a vertical line of 3s (each as a pair) in the same columns.\n\nIn example0, the 6,6 in row3 adds two rows of 3s (row4 and5). The 8,4 in row5 adds three rows (7,8,9). The 7,7 in row6 adds one row (7).\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\nFor 6,6 in row3:\n\n3s are added in row4 and5. Row4 is directly below row3, then row5. So two rows.\n\nFor 8,4 in row5:\n\n3s are added in rows7,8,9. Which is three rows, starting two rows below.\n\nFor 7,7 in row6:\n\n3s are added in row7, which is directly below.\n\nSo why the difference in starting row? For 8,4 in row5, the 3s start in row7. What's between row5 and7? Row6 has 7,7. So maybe if the next row (row6) is occupied by another pair in different columns, the 3s start after that pair's 3s.\n\nWait, in example0's input, the 8,4 are in row5. The next row (row6) has7,7. The 3s for8,4 start in row7. So the 3s are added starting two rows after the original pair, skipping the row where the7,7 pair is. But the 7,7's 3s are in row7. So perhaps the 3s from multiple pairs can overlap.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the pattern is that each horizontal pair in the input generates a vertical line of 3,3 starting from the next row, and continuing downward until they hit another pair's vertical line. Or perhaps the number of rows is determined by some property of the original pair.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair in the input generates a vertical line of 3s that are the same length as the pair's values. For example, 6,6 generates two 3s (rows4 and5). 8,4 generates four 3s (rows7-10, but since the grid is 10 rows, it's three). But 8,4 would be four rows, but the grid only has up to row9. So rows7-9 is three rows. 7,7 would generate seven rows, but only one is present.\n\nThis doesn't fit. So I'm stuck.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a different pattern. Maybe the 3s are added in the same columns for each pair, but the number of rows is the number of pairs that are aligned vertically.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output's 3s, perhaps they form a sort of waterfall effect. Each pair in the input causes 3s to flow down until another pair is encountered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added below each pair for a number of rows equal to the sum of the pair divided by 3, rounded down. For example, 6+6=12 \u2192 12/3=4 \u2192 four rows. But in example0, there are two rows. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 3s is the sum of the pair divided by 3. For example:\n\n6+6=12 \u2192 12/3=4 \u2192 four rows. But example0 has two. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let me try a different approach. Let's compare the input and output for the examples and see which cells change.\n\nIn example0's input, the changes from input to output are:\n\nRow4: [0,3,3,...]\n\nRow5: columns1-2 3,3 added.\n\nRow7: columns5-6 3,3 added.\n\nRow8: same.\n\nRow9: same.\n\nSo for each pair in the input, the output adds 3,3 in the same columns, but starting one or more rows below.\n\nIn example0:\n\n- The 6,6 pair in row3 leads to 3,3 in row4 and5.\n\n- The 8,4 pair in row5 leads to 3,3 in rows7,8,9.\n\n- The7,7 pair in row6 leads to 3,3 in row7.\n\nWait, in row7, columns5-6 have 3,3 from both the8,4 pair and the7,7 pair. But the output shows 3,3 there. So overlapping is allowed.\n\nSo perhaps each pair in the input adds 3,3 in the same columns, but shifted down by one row and for a certain number of times. For example:\n\n- For the6,6 pair: add 3,3 in row4 and5 (two instances).\n\n- For the8,4 pair: add 3,3 in row7,8,9 (three instances).\n\n- For the7,7 pair: add 3,3 in row7 (one instance).\n\nThe question is why some pairs generate more instances than others.\n\nAnother observation: The pairs in example0's input are located in different rows. The 6,6 is in row3. The 8,4 in row5. The7,7 in row6. The 3s for 6,6 are in rows4 and5. The 3s for 8,4 start two rows after (row7). The 3s for7,7 start in row7 (next row).\n\nSo the number of rows between the original pair and the first 3s varies. For 6,6 (row3) \u2192 row4 (1 row below). For 8,4 (row5) \u2192 row7 (two rows below). For7,7 (row6) \u2192 row7 (1 row below).\n\nWhy the difference? Maybe because there's another pair in between. For example, the8,4 is in row5. The next pair is7,7 in row6. So the 3s for8,4 start after that. So maybe the 3s for a pair start in the next available row after the next pair's own 3s.\n\nBut in example0's case, the7,7's 3s are in row7. The8,4's 3s start in row7. So overlapping.\n\nThis seems too vague. I need to find a pattern that can be applied to all examples.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where 3s are added in the output and see how they relate to the input pairs.\n\nIn example0:\n\nInput pairs at rows2,3,5,6.\n\nOutput 3s added at rows4,5,7,8,9.\n\nIn example1:\n\nInput pairs at rows1,2,4,5.\n\nOutput 3s added at rows3,4,5,6,7.\n\nIn example2:\n\nInput pairs at rows1,2,5,6.\n\nOutput 3s added at rows3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nLooking for a pattern: For each input pair at row i, the output adds 3s starting at row j = i + k, where k varies.\n\nFor example0's row3 (6,6) \u2192 rows4 and5 (k=1 and 2).\n\nRow5 (8,4) \u2192 rows7,8,9 (k=2,3,4).\n\nRow6 (7,7) \u2192 row7 (k=1).\n\nExample1's row2 (9,4) \u2192 rows3,4,5 (k=1,2,3).\n\nRow4 (2,1) \u2192 row6 (k=2).\n\nRow5 (1,2) \u2192 row7 (k=2).\n\nExample2's row1 (2,4) \u2192 rows3,4,5 (k=2,3,4).\n\nRow2 (6,7) \u2192 rows3,4,5 (k=1,2,3).\n\nRow5 (7,6) \u2192 row7 (k=2).\n\nRow6 (6,6) \u2192 rows7,8 (k=1,2).\n\nThis is confusing. I can't see a clear pattern for k.\n\nAlternative idea: Each input pair adds 3s in the same columns for the next n rows, where n is determined by the value of the pair's digits. For example, if the pair is (a, b), then n = a + b. But 6+6=12 \u2192 12 rows, which is impossible. So no.\n\nAlternatively, n is the sum of the digits modulo the grid size. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, n is the minimum of the two digits. For example, 6,6 \u2192 6 rows. But example0 has two rows. So no.\n\nAnother observation: In example0's output, the 3s for the 6,6 pair are in rows4 and5. Then the 3s for the8,4 pair are in rows7,8,9. The gap between row5 and7 is two rows. Perhaps because there's a pair in row6 (7,7) which generates 3s in row7. So the 3s from8,4 start after the 7,7's 3s.\n\nBut how does that determine the number of rows?\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the 3s as falling blocks. Each pair in the input generates a block of 3s that falls downward, possibly stacking or overlapping with other blocks.\n\nIn example0, the 6,6 pair generates two 3s below. Then the 8,4 pair generates three 3s. The 7,7 pair generates one 3.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the number of 3s added is equal to the number of steps until another pair is encountered. For example, for the 6,6 pair in row3, the next pair is in row5 (8,4), which is two rows below. So 3s are added for two rows (rows4 and5). Then the8,4 pair is followed by a pair in row6 (7,7), which is one row below. So 3s are added for one row (row7), but in example0, there are three rows. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 3 rows is the number of rows between the original pair and the next pair in any column. For example, for the 6,6 pair in row3, the next pair in row5 (columns5-6) is two rows away. So 3s are added for two rows. Then the next pair is in row6 (row below), so 3s are added for one row. But how does this explain example0's output for the8,4 pair?\n\nHmm. Let's try to count the gaps:\n\nFor 6,6 in row3: next pair is in row5 (8,4). So two rows below. 3s added for two rows (4 and5). \n\nFor8,4 in row5: next pair is in row6 (7,7). One row below. So 3s added for one row (7). But in example0, the8,4's 3s are added in three rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 3 rows is the distance between the original pair and the bottom of the grid. For example, for row3 (6,6), there are 6 rows below (rows4-9). But in the output, 3s are added for two rows. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if the 3s are added in the same columns, but the first 3s are added in the row immediately below the pair, and then every other row. For example, 6,6 in row3 \u2192 3s in row4,5,6... but the output stops at row5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are added in the same columns for each pair, and the number of 3 rows is determined by the sum of the digits divided by 3, rounded down. For example, 6+6=12 \u2192 4 rows. But in example0, only two. No.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at all three examples, the output seems to add 3,3 pairs in the same columns as the input pairs, but starting one or more rows below. The number of rows varies, but seems to be two or three.\n\nIn example0:\n\n- For the6,6 pair (row3): 3s in row4 and5 (two rows).\n\n- For the8,4 pair (row5): 3s in rows7,8,9 (three rows).\n\n- For the7,7 pair (row6): 3s in row7 (one row).\n\nIn example1:\n\n- For the9,4 pair (row2): 3s in rows3,4,5 (three rows).\n\n- For the2,1 and1,2 pairs (rows4 and5): 3s in rows6 and7 (two rows each? Or combined).\n\nIn example2:\n\n- For the2,4 and6,7 pairs (rows1 and2): 3s in rows3,4,5 (three rows each).\n\n- For the7,6 and6,6 pairs (rows5 and6): 3s in rows7 and8 (two rows).\n\nSo perhaps the number of 3 rows is determined by whether the pair is followed by another pair. For example, if a pair is followed by another pair in the same columns, it adds fewer rows, but if not, it adds more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps pairs that are part of a vertical stack generate more 3 rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 3 rows is three if the pair is in an even row and two if odd. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 3 rows is three for pairs where the sum is even and two for odd sums. But example0's 6+6=12 (even) has two rows. So no.\n\nThis is really tricky. Given the time I've spent and not found a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,0,0,0,0,2,9,0,0]\n\n[2,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,8,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n...\n\nSo the input has pairs:\n\nRow1 (second row):1,1 in columns0-1.\n\nRow2:2,1 in columns0-1.\n\nRow3:4,7 in columns3-4.\n\nRow4:8,4 in columns3-4.\n\nSo these are the pairs to consider.\n\nFor each of these pairs, we need to add 3s in the same columns below.\n\nLooking at the training examples, pairs like 1,1 and 2,1 (different numbers) would generate 3s below.\n\nIn example1, the pair 9,4 (different numbers) generated three rows of 3s. The pairs 2,1 and1,2 (different) generated two rows.\n\nSo perhaps different-number pairs generate three rows of 3s, while same-number pairs generate two? Not sure.\n\nIn example0, the 8,4 (different) generated three rows. The 6,6 (same) generated two rows. 7,7 (same) generated one row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, same-number pairs generate two rows, different generate three. But in example0's 7,7 generated one row, which contradicts.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut given the test input, let's apply the pattern observed in the examples:\n\nFor each horizontal pair in the input, add 3,3 in the same columns for three rows below if the pair has different numbers, and two rows if the same.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair, add three rows of 3s.\n\nIn example0's 6,6 (same), two rows. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, regardless of the numbers, each pair adds three rows of 3s. But example0's 6,6 added two, and 7,7 added one. So this can't be.\n\nAnother approach: For the test input, we need to identify the pairs and see where the 3s would be added.\n\nThe test input's pairs:\n\nRow1:1,1 (columns0-1).\n\nRow2:2,1 (columns0-1). These are two pairs in the same columns. \n\nRow3:4,7 (columns3-4).\n\nRow4:8,4 (columns3-4).\n\nSo for each of these pairs, add 3s below.\n\nIn example0, when there were multiple pairs in the same columns (like 9,9 and6,6 in columns1-2), the 3s were added for each pair. For example, 9,9 in row2 did not generate 3s, but 6,6 in row3 did generate 3s in row4 and5.\n\nSo perhaps each pair contributes to adding 3s in the same columns, regardless of other pairs.\n\nIn the test input, row1 has 1,1. Below it, in row2, there's a pair 2,1. So maybe the 3s for 1,1 in row1 would start in row2. But row2 has a pair already. Perhaps the 3s are added below any existing pairs.\n\nAlternatively, in example0's row3 (6,6) has 3s in row4 and5. So perhaps the 3s for row1's 1,1 would start in row2 and add 3s for two rows. But row2 has a pair (2,1) which might interfere.\n\nAlternatively, the pairs are processed from top to bottom. So first, handle row1's 1,1 pair. Add 3s in row2 and3. Then handle row2's 2,1 pair, adding 3s in row3 and4. But row2's pair is in the same columns as row1's. So the 3s from row1's pair would be overwritten by the 3s from row2's pair.\n\nBut in example0, the 9,9 in row2 and6,6 in row3 (same columns) resulted in 3s in row4 and5 (from6,6). The 9,9 pair didn't add any 3s. So maybe only certain pairs generate 3s.\n\nAlternatively, the pairs generate 3s in the next rows, but if there's another pair in the same columns, their 3s override. \n\nIn the test input, row1's 1,1 pair would generate 3s in row2 and3. But row2 has a pair 2,1, which is also a pair. So perhaps the 3s from row1 are added in row2 and3, but row2's own pair would generate 3s in row3 and4. But the 3s from row1 and row2's pairs would overlap in row3.\n\nBut according to example0, the 9,9 pair (row2) didn't generate 3s, but the 6,6 pair (row3) did. So perhaps only pairs that are the first in their columns generate 3s.\n\nAlternatively, only pairs with even numbers generate 3s. But example0's 7,7 (7 is odd) generated 3s. So that's not.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to apply the following pattern based on the examples:\n\nFor each horizontal pair in the input, add 3,3 in the same columns for three rows below the pair. However, if another pair is present in the same columns below, adjust the number of rows accordingly.\n\nIn the test input, the pairs are:\n\nRow1:1,1 (columns0-1) \u2192 add 3s in row2,3,4.\n\nRow2:2,1 (columns0-1) \u2192 add 3s in row3,4,5.\n\nRow3:4,7 (columns3-4) \u2192 add 3s in row4,5,6.\n\nRow4:8,4 (columns3-4) \u2192 add 3s in row5,6,7.\n\nBut since these are overlapping, the 3s would accumulate.\n\nBut let's look at the expected output structure. The output for the test input would have:\n\nFor row1's 1,1 pair: 3s in row2,3,4 (columns0-1).\n\nRow2's 2,1 pair: 3s in row3,4,5 (columns0-1).\n\nRow3's 4,7 pair: 3s in row4,5,6 (columns3-4).\n\nRow4's 8,4 pair: 3s in row5,6,7 (columns3-4).\n\nBut since the grid is only 10 rows (0-9), the 3s would be added accordingly.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: original [1,1,0,0,0,0,2,9,0,0].\n\nRow2: original [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0], but with 3s added in columns0-1 if applicable.\n\nWait, no. The input is given, and the output modifies certain rows by adding 3s. So for the test input, the output would be the same as the input, plus 3s added in certain rows and columns.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow1: 1,1 in columns0-1. Add 3s in row2,3,4 (columns0-1).\n\nRow2: 2,1 in columns0-1. Add 3s in row3,4,5 (columns0-1).\n\nRow3:4,7 in columns3-4. Add 3s in row4,5,6 (columns3-4).\n\nRow4:8,4 in columns3-4. Add 3s in row5,6,7 (columns3-4).\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRow2: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0] \u2192 but also 3s added from row1's pair. But according to the examples, the original values are retained except for the added 3s. Wait, in example0's input, row5 has 8,4 in the input, and the output row5 has 3,3 in columns1-2 (from the 6,6) and the original 8,4 in columns5-6. So the added 3s don't overwrite existing values. So in the test input's row2, the original values are 2,1 in columns0-1. If we add 3s from row1's pair in row2, columns0-1, but row2's existing values are 2,1, which are not zero. So according to the examples, the 3s are added only in zero cells. But in example0's output, row5 has both 3,3 (from the 6,6) and 8,4 (original) in different columns. So the 3s are added in the same columns as the pair, regardless of existing values. Wait, but in example0's output, row5's columns1-2 are 3,3 (added), and columns5-6 are 8,4 (original). So the 3s overwrite the original zeros but not other numbers. So if the original cell is non-zero, it remains. Only zeros are replaced with 3s when applicable.\n\nSo in the test input's row2, columns0-1 are 2 and1 (non-zero), so adding 3s from row1's pair would not replace them. Thus, row2 would remain [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0].\n\nThen, for row1's pair, the 3s are added in rows2,3,4 columns0-1. But row2's columns0-1 are non-zero, so 3s are not added there. Row3's columns0-1 are 0,0 (original), so add 3,3. Row4's columns0-1 are 0,0 (original), add 3,3. \n\nSimilarly, row2's pair (2,1) would add 3s in rows3,4,5 columns0-1. So in row3, columns0-1: 3,3 (from row1's pair) + 3,3 (from row2's pair) \u2192 but since they are already 3,3, they remain.\n\nRow4's columns0-1: 3,3 (from row1) + 3,3 (from row2) \u2192 still 3,3.\n\nRow5's columns0-1: 0,0 \u2192 add 3,3 from row2's pair.\n\nFor the pairs in row3 (4,7) and row4 (8,4):\n\nRow3's pair adds 3s in rows4,5,6 columns3-4.\n\nRow4's pair adds 3s in rows5,6,7 columns3-4.\n\nSo row4's columns3-4: 8,4 in the original input, but in the output, the 3s from row3's pair would try to add 3,3 here. However, the original values are non-zero (8 and4), so the 3s are not added. \n\nRow5's columns3-4: 0,0 \u2192 add 3,3 from both row3 and row4's pairs. So 3,3.\n\nRow6's columns3-4: 0,0 \u2192 add 3,3 from row3's pair (row4,5,6) and row4's pair (rows5,6,7). So 3,3.\n\nRow7's columns3-4: 0,0 \u2192 add 3,3 from row4's pair.\n\nSo putting this together, the output would look like:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,0,0,0,2,9,0,0].\n\nRow2: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0].\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 but add 3,3 in columns0-1 (from row1 and row2's pairs) \u2192 becomes [3,3,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: original [0,0,0,8,4,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 add 3,3 in columns0-1 (from row1 and row2) \u2192 [3,3,0,8,4,0,0,0,0,0]. Also, row3's pair adds 3s to row4's columns3-4, but original values are 8 and4, so no change.\n\nRow5: originally all zeros. Add 3,3 in columns0-1 (from row2's pair) and 3,3 in columns3-4 (from row3 and row4's pairs). So columns0-1:3,3; columns3-4:3,3 \u2192 [3,3,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow6: add 3,3 in columns3-4 (from row3 and row4's pairs) \u2192 [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow7: add 3,3 in columns3-4 (from row4's pair) \u2192 [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRows8 and9: all zeros.\n\nAdditionally, we need to check if there are any other pairs in the input that I might have missed. For example, in row1's columns6-7: 2,9. Are they a pair? They are adjacent but 2 and9 are different. In the examples, pairs can be any adjacent numbers. So perhaps this pair also generates 3s. But according to the training examples, pairs are any two adjacent numbers, regardless of their values. So in row1, columns6-7 have 2,9. So that's another pair. Similarly, row2 has columns6-7:1,6. That's another pair. So these pairs would also generate 3s.\n\nSo for the test input, the pairs are:\n\nRow1: columns0-1 (1,1), columns6-7 (2,9).\n\nRow2: columns0-1 (2,1), columns6-7 (1,6).\n\nRow3: columns3-4 (4,7).\n\nRow4: columns3-4 (8,4).\n\nEach of these pairs would generate 3s in the same columns below.\n\nSo for row1's pair 2,9 in columns6-7:\n\nAdd 3s in rows2,3,4 columns6-7.\n\nRow2's pair 1,6 in columns6-7:\n\nAdd 3s in rows3,4,5 columns6-7.\n\nRow3's pair4,7 columns3-4:\n\nAdd 3s in rows4,5,6 columns3-4.\n\nRow4's pair8,4 columns3-4:\n\nAdd 3s in rows5,6,7 columns3-4.\n\nSo now, updating the previous analysis:\n\nFor row2's columns6-7:1,6 (pair). Add 3s in rows3,4,5 columns6-7.\n\nRow3's columns6-7 in input are 0,0. So in row3's output, columns6-7 would be 3,3 from row1's pair (rows2,3,4) and row2's pair (rows3,4,5). So row3's columns6-7: 3,3.\n\nRow4's columns6-7: from row1's pair (row2,3,4) \u2192 rows2,3,4. So row4's columns6-7 would be 3,3 (from row1's pair's row4) and row2's pair's rows3,4,5. So row4's columns6-7:3,3.\n\nRow5's columns6-7: from row2's pair's row5 \u2192 3,3.\n\nSimilarly, row3's pair4,7 (columns3-4) add 3s in rows4,5,6. But row4's columns3-4 are8,4 (non-zero), so no change. Rows5 and6's columns3-4 are zeros, so 3,3.\n\nRow4's pair8,4 (columns3-4) add 3s in rows5,6,7. So row5's columns3-4:3,3 (from row3 and row4), row6's columns3-4:3,3 (from row3 and row4), row7's columns3-4:3,3 (from row4).\n\nNow, combining all these:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,0,0,0,2,9,0,0].\n\nRow2: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0].\n\nRow3:\n\n- Columns0-1:3,3 (from row1 and row2's pairs).\n\n- Columns6-7:3,3 (from row1 and row2's pairs).\n\nSo row3 becomes [3,3,0,4,7,0,3,3,0,0].\n\nWait, original row3 is [0,0,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,0]. The added 3s in columns0-1 and6-7. The 4 and7 remain.\n\nRow4:\n\n- Columns0-1:3,3.\n\n- Columns3-4:8,4 (original, non-zero).\n\n- Columns6-7:3,3.\n\nSo row4 becomes [3,3,0,8,4,0,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow5:\n\n- Columns0-1:3,3 (from row2's pair).\n\n- Columns3-4:3,3 (from row3 and row4's pairs).\n\n- Columns6-7:3,3 (from row2's pair).\n\nSo row5 becomes [3,3,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow6:\n\n- Columns3-4:3,3 (from row3 and row4's pairs).\n\n- Columns6-7: from row2's pair (row5), which is row5's columns6-7 3,3, but row6's columns6-7 are zeros. So no 3s from row2's pair. Wait, row2's pair adds 3s in rows3,4,5. So row6's columns6-7 are not affected by row2's pair. Only row3,4,5.\n\nBut row1's pair (2,9) adds 3s in rows2,3,4. So row6's columns6-7 are not affected by that either.\n\nWait, row1's pair in columns6-7 adds 3s in rows2,3,4. So row6's columns6-7 are not modified by row1's pair. So row6's columns6-7 remain 0.\n\nBut row4's pair adds 3s in columns3-4 for rows5,6,7. And row3's pair adds 3s in columns3-4 for rows4,5,6.\n\nSo in row6's columns3-4:3,3 (from row3 and row4's pairs).\n\nSo row6 becomes [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow7:\n\n- Columns3-4:3,3 (from row4's pair).\n\nSo row7 becomes [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRows8 and9 remain zeros.\n\nPutting all together, the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9, 0, 0]\n[2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 0, 0]\n[3, 3, 0, 4, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n[3, 3, 0, 8, 4, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n[3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, the output adds 3s but keeps the original non-zero values. For example, in example0's row5 in the output, the 8,4 are still present. So in the test input's row3 and4, the original numbers (4,7 in row3;8,4 in row4) should remain, and the 3s are added only in the zero cells.\n\nSo the final output would be as described above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 10x10 grid of numbers, and the output seems to add some 3s in certain places. Let me check each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 9s, 6s, 8, 4, and 7s. The output adds 3s below the 6s and around the 8 and 4. Like in row 4, which was all zeros before, now there's 3,3. Then rows 5 have 3,3 next to the 8 and 4. Then below the 7s, there are 3s in rows 7,8,9. Hmm. Maybe the 3s are being added adjacent to certain numbers, but how?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 4,8,9,4,2,1,1,2. The output adds 3s around those numbers. For instance, below the 9 and 4 in row 2, row 3 has 3,3. Then the 2 and 1 in row 4 and 5 get 3s below them. So maybe when there are adjacent non-zero numbers, 3s are placed in a certain pattern around them.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the 3s are arranged in vertical or horizontal pairs. Like in Example 0, after the 6,6 in row 3, the next row (4) has 3,3. Then in row 5, the 3s are next to the 8 and 4. Then under the 7s, the 3s are placed in the next rows. Maybe the 3s are placed adjacent to the original numbers, either below or to the side, but only if certain conditions are met.\n\nAnother observation: The 3s might be forming a kind of \"border\" around clusters of numbers. Or perhaps they are filling in the areas adjacent to pairs of the same number. For example, in Example 0, the 9,9 and 6,6 are pairs. The 3s are placed below them. Then the 8 and 4 are single, but adjacent, so maybe 3s are added next to them. Then the 7,7 pair gets 3s below.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's input, there's a 4 and 8 in row 1. Then 9 and 4 in row 2. The output adds 3s in row 3, 3,3. Then in rows 4 and 5, they add 3s next to the 2 and 1. So maybe the rule is that when two numbers are adjacent (either vertically or horizontally), their \"group\" gets surrounded by 3s in a certain direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added below and to the right of certain number pairs. Let's look at Example 0 again. The 9,9 in row 2, columns 1 and 2. Below them in row 3 is 6,6. Then below that (row 4) is 3,3. Then the 8 and 4 in row 5 (columns 5 and 6) are followed by 3s in row 6 (columns 5 and 6). Wait, but in the output for Example 0, the 7,7 in row 6 (columns 5 and 6) have 3s below them in rows 7,8,9. So each time a pair is found, the 3s are placed below them, perhaps cascading down.\n\nWait, maybe each non-zero number is part of a structure that \"grows\" 3s in subsequent rows. Like, each number X has 3s added in the positions below it, but only if certain conditions are met. But how exactly?\n\nAnother approach: Let's see the transformation from input to output. For each cell in the output, when does it become 3? Let's compare input and output cells.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOriginal input row 3 (index 2 if starting from 0) has 9,9. The output adds 3,3 in row 4 (index 3). Then the 6,6 in row 3 (index 3) adds 3,3 in row 4 (index 4). Then the 8 and 4 in row 5 (columns 5 and 6) have 3s added in row 6 (columns 5 and 6) but wait no, the output in row 5 (input row 5) now has 3,3 in columns 1 and 2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the rows mixed up.\n\nWait, the input in Example 0 has:\n\nRow 2 (0-based index 2): [0,9,9,0,...]\n\nRow 3: [0,6,6,0,...]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,8,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,...]\n\nThe output adds in row 4 (index 4) [0,3,3,0,...], row 5 has 3,3 in the same columns as the 8 and 4? Wait, in row 5 of the output, columns 0 and 1 are 0, but the input row 5 has 8 and 4 in columns 5 and 6. But in the output, the 3s are in columns 1 and 2 (same as the 9,9 and 6,6). So maybe the 3s are added below each pair, but only for certain numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are added in the same positions as the original numbers but shifted down by one row, but only if the cell below is zero. But in Example 0, the 9,9 in row 2 are followed by 6,6 in row 3. Then the 3s in row 4. So each time, the next row down gets 3s. But in Example 1, the 4,8 in row 1 are followed by 9,4 in row 2, and then 3,3 in row 3.\n\nWait, maybe the 3s are added whenever a cell and its adjacent (right or below) neighbor form a certain pair. For example, if two same numbers are adjacent horizontally, then in the next row below, 3s are placed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are being added in all the cells that are adjacent (including diagonally) to the original non-zero numbers. But that doesn't fit because the 3s are placed in specific directions.\n\nWait, another angle: the output grids have 3s that form a kind of \"shadow\" below or to the side of the original numbers. For instance, in Example 0, the original 9,9 and 6,6 are vertical pairs. The 3s are added below each of these pairs. Similarly, the 8 and 4 (which are adjacent but not the same) get 3s next to them. The 7,7 pair has 3s added below.\n\nBut how does that work? Let's see:\n\nOriginal pairs (same numbers adjacent) like 9,9 and 6,6 in Example 0. The 3s are placed below them. Then the 8 and 4 (different numbers, adjacent) have 3s placed to their left? Or maybe 3s are placed where the numbers would \"flow\" downward. Like, if there's a block of two same numbers, then the next row below gets 3s. Then perhaps those 3s would then have their own 3s in the next rows. But in the output of Example 0, the 3s in row 4 (from the 6,6) are followed by 3,3 in row 5 (columns 1,2) as well? Wait, row 5 in the output has 3,3 in columns 1 and 2, which is same as the 6,6 in row 3. Hmm, maybe each time, the 3s are placed in the same columns but two rows below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added in all the cells that are adjacent (touching) to the original numbers, but then only in certain directions.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output:\n\nOriginal 9,9 in row 2. Then 6,6 in row 3. Then 3,3 in row 4 and row 5. So perhaps each layer is a step down, and the 3s are added as a continuation. Maybe the numbers are \"falling\" down, leaving 3s behind. For example, 9s are at row 2, then 6s at row 3, then 3s at rows 4,5, etc. Similarly, 8 and 4 in row 5, then 7,7 in row 6, then 3s below them. So maybe each number is part of a vertical chain where each subsequent row has the next lower number, and when they can't go lower, they turn into 3s. Wait, but 9\u21926\u21923? 9 minus 3 is 6, 6 minus 3 is 3. Then 8 and 4: 8-4=4, but in the output, they have 3s next to them. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each time a pair of same numbers is found, a 3,3 is placed below them. Then any pair of same numbers in the output (including the 3s) would generate more 3s below. But in Example 0, the 3,3 in row 4 would generate 3s in row 5, but in the output, row 5 also has 3,3 in the same columns. So maybe this is a recursive process where 3s generate more 3s below them.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output rows 4,5,6,7,8,9 for columns 1 and 2:\n\nRow 4: 3,3.\n\nRow 5: 3,3.\n\nRow 6: 0,0.\n\nWait, no. Row 5 in the output has 3,3 in columns 1 and 2 (same as row 4), but row 6 has 0. Then rows 7,8,9 for columns 5 and 6 (originally 8,4 in input row 5) have 3s.\n\nWait, maybe the 3s are only added once per original pair, not recursively. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nThe 9,9 in row 2, columns 1 and 2.\n\nIn output, 3,3 appears in row 4 (same columns). The 6,6 in row 3, columns 1 and 2 have 3,3 in row 4 (same columns). Wait, row 4 in the output is [0,3,3,0,...]. So that's combining both the 9,9 and 6,6's 3s? But how?\n\nWait, maybe each time a vertical pair is found (two same numbers in consecutive rows in the same column), then 3s are added below. For example, if two same numbers are stacked vertically, their columns get 3s below. But in Example 0, the 9,9 and 6,6 are not stacked vertically. The 9,9 is in row 2, 6,6 in row 3. So maybe each pair of same numbers in adjacent rows (same columns) would generate 3s. But in this case, they are in adjacent rows but different columns. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's check the positions where 3s are added. For each example, look at the input and output.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOriginal numbers are 9,9 in row 2 (columns 1-2), 6,6 in row 3 (1-2), 8 in row 5 (5), 4 in row 5 (6), 7,7 in row 6 (5-6).\n\nIn the output, the 3s are added:\n\n- In row 4 (columns 1-2) below the 6,6.\n\n- In row 5 (columns 1-2) again 3,3 (same as row 4).\n\nWait, that's not directly below the 6,6 (row 3's 6,6 would be row 4's 3,3. Then row 5's 3,3 would be under row 4's 3,3.\n\nSimilarly, the 8 and 4 in row 5 (columns 5-6) have 3,3 in row 7,8,9 (columns 5-6). The 7,7 in row 6 (columns 5-6) would have 3s below them in rows 7,8,9. Wait, the output's row 7,8,9 have 3,3 in columns 5-6.\n\nBut how is this determined?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are placed in all positions directly below and two rows down from each pair of same numbers, but this seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the 3s are added in the cells that are diagonally adjacent. For instance, below and to the left/right. But in Example 0, the 3s are directly below the 6,6. Maybe each pair of same numbers (horizontally adjacent) causes a 3,3 to be placed one row below, same columns. Then any 3,3 pair would also generate another 3,3 below them, leading to a vertical line of 3s.\n\nIn Example 0, the 9,9 pair (row 2, cols 1-2) has 6,6 below in row 3, cols 1-2. Then 3,3 in row 4, cols 1-2. Then another 3,3 in row 5, cols 1-2. Wait, but row 4's 3,3 would then generate row 5's 3,3, but then why stop there?\n\nHmm, maybe each pair of same numbers (horizontal) generates a 3,3 below them, but only once. Then any existing 3,3 pairs would generate another 3,3 below, and so on until the bottom of the grid.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- The 9,9 in row 2: generate 3,3 in row 3. But in the input, row 3 has 6,6. Wait, but in the output, row 4 has the 3,3. So maybe the original pairs (non-3) generate 3s in the next row, but 3s themselves also generate 3s below.\n\nWait, in the output of Example 0, the 3s start appearing in row 4 (from 6,6 in row 3). Then row 4's 3s generate row 5's 3s, which generate row 6's 3s? But in the output, row 6's columns 1-2 are 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are added below each original non-zero number, but only if the cell directly below is zero, and the cell to the right is also part of a pair.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 3s often form a vertical line or a horizontal line adjacent to the original numbers. For instance, in Example 2's input, there are pairs like 2,4, 6,7, etc. The output adds 3s around them, forming borders.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added in all cells that are adjacent (including diagonally) to at least two non-zero cells. But I need to verify that.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 3s in row 4, columns 1-2: what's adjacent to those? The cells above are 6,6 (row 3), and below (row 5) becomes 3,3. But why would that generate 3s there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are formed by adding the digits of adjacent cells. For example, 9 and 6 could sum to 15, but 3 is not related. That seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let's look at the numbers. 9, 6, 3: each is 3 less than the previous. 9-3=6, 6-3=3. Then 8 and 4: 8-4=4. 7-3=4? Hmm, maybe not. But perhaps the 3s are the result of subtracting 3 from the number above. For example, in Example 0, 9 becomes 6 (row 2 to 3), 6 becomes 3 (row 3 to 4). Then 3 would continue downward. Similarly, 8 in row 5 would become 5 in row 6, but the output has 7 in row 6. That doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the 3s are added to the grid where the original numbers form a \"shape\", and the 3s outline or fill in the areas around them. For example, if there's a vertical line of numbers, the 3s are added next to them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added to the cells that are between two non-zero numbers. For instance, if there's a horizontal pair, then 3s are added below. If there's a vertical pair, 3s are added to the side. But I need to check.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 4 and 8 are adjacent in row 1. In the output, there's 3,3 in row 3. But why row 3? Maybe there's a gap between the original numbers and the 3s. For example, the 4 and 8 are in row 1, columns 2 and 3. The 3s are in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So two rows below.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0, the 9,9 in row 2 have 3s in row 4 (two rows below). The 6,6 in row 3 have 3s in row 4 (directly below). Then the 8 and 4 in row 5 have 3s in row 7, which is two rows below. The 7,7 in row 6 have 3s in rows 7,8,9, each row below.\n\nWait, maybe the number of rows the 3s are added below depends on the value of the original numbers. For example, 9/3 = 3, so 3 rows below? But 9 divided by 3 is 3. Then for 6, it's 2 rows. But in Example 0, the 9,9 in row 2 would generate 3s three rows below (row 5). But in the output, they are in row 4 and 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero number X adds a 3 in the cell X/3 rows below. But 9/3=3, so three rows below row 2 (row 5). But in the output, the 3s start in row 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the 3s are added in the cells that are adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the original numbers, but only if they are zero in the input, and they turn into 3s in the output. But looking at Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal 9,9 in row 2. Adjacent cells would be row 1 and 3, columns 1-2. But in the output, the 3s are in row 4. That's not adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell in the input generates a 3 in the cell directly below, but only if the cell below is zero. Then, if the cell below is also non-zero, it generates a 3 to the right or left. But this might not explain all cases.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nRow 2 has 9,9. Row 3 has 6,6. So the 9,9's cells in row 2 would try to place 3s below, but since row 3 has 6,6, which are non-zero, so perhaps they can't. Then the 6,6 in row 3 would place 3s below in row 4. Which is what the output shows.\n\nThe 8 and 4 in row 5: since they are adjacent but not the same, maybe each places a 3 below. But since they are adjacent, the 3s are placed below each, resulting in 3s in row 6. But in the output, the 8 and 4 are in row 5, and the 3s start in row 7. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, when two different numbers are adjacent, they generate 3s diagonally. For example, 8 and 4 (row 5, cols 5 and 6) generate 3s in row 7, cols 5 and 6. But why row 7?\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the pattern is that for each pair of adjacent numbers (horizontal or vertical), a 3,3 block is added either below or to the right, creating a sort of extension. Then, those 3s might themselves form new pairs that generate more 3s, but maybe only once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added in the next available rows after the original numbers, creating a vertical \"tail\". For example, each non-zero pair adds 3s one row below, and this repeats until the bottom of the grid.\n\nIn Example 0, the 9,9 pair in row 2 would generate 3s in row 3, but row 3 has 6,6, so instead, those 6,6 generate 3s in row 4. Then those 3s in row 4 generate 3s in row 5, and so on until the bottom. So each time a block is present, it adds 3s in the next row, which then continue down.\n\nBut why in Example 0's output, the 3s in row 4 and 5 are in the same columns as the original 9,9 and 6,6. The 3s in row 4 are directly below the 6,6, but then row 5's 3s are in the same columns. Then row 6 has 0s there, but the 3s start again in rows 7,8,9 under the 7,7 pair.\n\nHmm. So maybe the 3s are generated in a way that each non-zero pair (horizontal or vertical) creates a vertical line of 3s below them, starting from their position and continuing to the bottom.\n\nFor instance, in Example 0:\n\n- The 9,9 pair in row 2 starts a vertical line of 3s in columns 1-2 from row 4 onwards.\n\n- The 6,6 pair in row 3 adds to this, causing 3s from row 4.\n\n- The 8 and 4 in row 5 start a vertical line of 3s in columns 5-6 from row 7 onwards.\n\n- The 7,7 pair in row 6 starts a vertical line from row 7 onwards.\n\nBut why the 3s start at row 4 for the 9,9 and 6,6 pairs? Perhaps because the 9,9 and 6,6 are in consecutive rows. So after the 9,9 in row 2 and 6,6 in row 3, the 3s start in row 4. Then each subsequent row has 3s until the bottom.\n\nSimilarly, the 8 and 4 in row 5 would start their 3s in row 7 (two rows below), but why two rows? Maybe because there's a gap between them and the next pair.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s start two rows below any non-pair (single numbers). But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see what's common in all examples. The 3s are always added in pairs (3,3) either vertically or horizontally, and they seem to be positioned below or adjacent to existing non-zero pairs.\n\nIn Example 2's input:\n\nRow 1 has 2,4 and row 2 has 6,7. The output adds 3,3 pairs in various places. For instance, in rows 3 and 4 (columns 2-3), rows 5-6 (columns 2-3), and others. It's possible that whenever there's a horizontal pair (two adjacent numbers, same or different), a vertical 3,3 pair is added two rows below. Or maybe each pair of adjacent numbers (even if different) generates a 3,3 block two rows below.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 9,9 pair in row 2 has 3s starting in row 4 (two rows below), which fits. The 6,6 in row 3 have 3s in row 4 (one row below). Hmm, not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are placed two rows below the original pairs. So for a pair in row n, the 3s are in row n+2. But in Example 0's 9,9 in row 2 (0-based), the 3s are in row 4 (n+2). The 6,6 in row 3 would be in row 5, but in the output they are in row 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let's look at the Test Input and see if we can find a pattern that would apply to it.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0,0,0,0,2,9,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,8,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOther rows are zeros.\n\nSo possible non-zero pairs:\n\nRow 1: 1,1 (columns 0-1).\n\nRow 2: 2,1 (columns 0-1) \u2014 not a pair.\n\nRow 1's 2,9 (columns 6-7) \u2014 different numbers.\n\nRow 2's 1,6 (columns 6-7) \u2014 different.\n\nRow 3: 4 and 7 (columns 3-4).\n\nRow 4: 8 and 4 (columns 3-4).\n\nSo possible pairs are 1,1 in row 1, and 4,7 and 8,4 in rows 3 and 4. But according to previous examples, even non-pairs (different numbers) might generate 3s. For example, Example 0's 8 and 4 were different but generated 3s.\n\nIn the output examples, when there are two adjacent numbers (same or different), they generate 3s either below or to the side. So in the Test Input, the 1,1 pair in row 1 would generate 3s in rows below. The 4 and 7 in row 3, and 8 and 4 in row 4 might generate 3s below them.\n\nLooking at the training examples, for pairs of same numbers (like 9,9 or 6,6), the 3s start directly below. For pairs of different numbers (like 8,4 or 4,8), the 3s are placed a few rows below, perhaps two rows down.\n\nIn Example 0's input, 8 and 4 are in row 5. The 3s appear in row 7 (two rows below). So perhaps for pairs of different numbers, the 3s are placed two rows below, while for same numbers, they are placed one row below.\n\nBut in Example 1's input, there's a 4 and 8 in row 1 (different), and the output has 3s in row 3 (two rows below). That fits. So same-number pairs get 3s one row below, different pairs get 3s two rows below.\n\nThen, once the 3s are placed, if those 3s form pairs (same or different), they would generate more 3s accordingly.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's output, the 3s in row 4 (same) generate 3s in row 5. Those generate more 3s in row 6, etc., until the bottom.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nRow 1 has 1,1 (same) \u2192 3s in row 2 (one row below). But in row 2 of the input, there's 2,1. So perhaps the 3s would replace those or be added in row 2. However, the existing numbers in row 2 might block that. Or maybe the 3s are added regardless.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, row 3 has 6,6 (same numbers) which are followed by 3s in row 4. But row 3's 6,6 are part of the input, so the 3s are added below them regardless of existing numbers. But that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the 3s are added regardless of existing numbers, overwriting them.\n\nBut in the training examples, the output retains the original numbers and adds 3s elsewhere. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 9,9 and 6,6 remain, and 3s are added below. So the 3s are added in new positions, not replacing existing numbers.\n\nSo for the Test Input:\n\n- 1,1 in row 1 (columns 0-1) \u2192 add 3s in row 2 (same columns). But row 2 has 2,1 in columns 0-1. So would the 3s replace those, or be placed elsewhere? In the training examples, the original numbers are kept. So maybe the 3s are added in addition to existing numbers if possible. But in the input, row 2's columns 0-1 are already occupied. So perhaps the 3s are placed in the next available row below.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are placed in the next available row below where the cells are zero. So for the 1,1 pair in row 1, the next row is row 2, which has 2 and 1. So not zero. So the 3s would be placed in row 3, columns 0-1. Then, if those are zero, they would generate more 3s below.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's row 3, columns 0-1 are zero. So perhaps the 3s are placed there.\n\nBut how to confirm this with the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nThe 9,9 in row 2. The next row (row 3) has 6,6. But the 3s are placed in row 4. So it seems that when the immediate next row is occupied, the 3s are placed further down.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each horizontal pair (adjacent same numbers), check the next row (same columns) for zeros. If they are zero, place 3s there. If not, move down until zeros are found and place 3s there.\n\nIn Example 0's 9,9 pair (row 2):\n\nRow 3 (same columns) has 6,6 \u2192 not zero. So check row 4 \u2192 zeros \u2192 place 3s there.\n\nFor the 6,6 pair (row 3):\n\nRow 4 (same columns) are zeros \u2192 place 3s there.\n\nThe 8 and 4 pair (different numbers) in row 5: perhaps different rules. For different numbers, check two rows below. Row 7 (row 5 + 2) \u2192 columns 5-6. Row 7 in the input is zeros \u2192 place 3s there.\n\nSimilarly, the 7,7 pair in row 6: check row 7 (same columns) \u2192 zeros \u2192 place 3s there.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nThe 4 and 8 (different) in row 1: check row 3 (row 1 + 2). Columns 2-3 are zeros \u2192 place 3s.\n\nThe 9 and 4 (different) in row 2: check row 4 (row 2 + 2). Columns 2-3: zeros \u2192 place 3s.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the 3s are added in row 3 and 4. So maybe for different pairs, the 3s are placed in the next row (row +1) if possible, but maybe that's not the case. Or perhaps the same/different pairs have different rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any pair (same or different), the 3s are placed in the next row where the two cells below are zeros. For example, for the 1,1 in row 1 of the Test Input:\n\nCheck row 2, columns 0-1. They have 2 and 1 \u2192 not zeros. So check row 3, columns 0-1. Those are zeros. So place 3s there.\n\nThen, for those 3s, check row 4: zeros \u2192 place 3s. And so on until the bottom.\n\nSimilarly, the 4 and 7 in row 3 (columns 3-4) of the Test Input are different. Check row 4 (same columns). Row 4 has 8 and 4 \u2192 not zeros. Check row 5 \u2192 zeros. So place 3s in row 5. Then row 6, etc.\n\nThe 8 and 4 in row 4: check row 5 \u2192 zeros \u2192 place 3s there. Then row 6, etc.\n\nIf this is the pattern, then the Test Input's output would have 3s placed as follows:\n\nFor the 1,1 in row 1:\n\n- row 3, cols 0-1: 3,3.\n\n- Then row 4, cols 0-1: 3,3.\n\n- Continue down until the bottom.\n\nFor the 2 and 9 in row 1 (cols 6-7), and 1 and 6 in row 2 (cols 6-7):\n\nThese are different pairs, but perhaps they are treated as individual numbers. Maybe any adjacent pair (horizontal or vertical) generates 3s below.\n\nBut the 2 and 9 are not adjacent. Wait, in row 1, columns 6-7 are 2 and 9. Are they considered a pair even though they're different? In Example 0's input, 8 and 4 (different) generated 3s. So maybe yes.\n\nSo for the 2 and 9 in row 1, cols 6-7:\n\nCheck row 2, cols 6-7 \u2192 1 and 6 \u2192 not zeros. Check row 3, cols 6-7 \u2192 zeros. Place 3s in row 3. But row 3 in the input has zeros in cols 6-7. So 3s there.\n\nThen row 4, cols 6-7 \u2192 zeros \u2192 3s.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSimilarly, the 1 and 6 in row 2, cols 6-7:\n\nCheck row 3, cols 6-7 \u2192 zeros \u2192 3s.\n\nBut since row 3's cols 6-7 are already being used for the 3s from the 2 and 9 pair, maybe they are merged.\n\nFor the 4 and 7 in row 3, cols 3-4:\n\nCheck row 4, cols 3-4 \u2192 8 and 4 \u2192 not zeros. Check row 5 \u2192 zeros \u2192 place 3s.\n\nFor the 8 and 4 in row 4, cols 3-4:\n\nCheck row 5, cols 3-4 \u2192 zeros \u2192 place 3s. Then row 6, etc.\n\nPutting it all together, the Test Input's output would have:\n\n- In row 3, cols 0-1: 3,3 (from the 1,1 pair).\n\n- In row 3, cols 6-7: 3,3 (from 2 and 9 and 1 and 6).\n\n- In row 5, cols 3-4: 3,3 (from 4 and 7).\n\n- In row 5, cols 3-4: 3,3 (from 8 and 4).\n\nWait, but row 4 has 8 and 4. Checking row 5, cols 3-4: zeros. So 3s there.\n\nThen those 3s would generate more 3s in rows 6,7, etc.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,0,0,0,2,9,0,0.\n\nRow 2: 2,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,0,4,7,0,3,3,0,0.\n\nRow 4: 0,0,0,8,4,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nRow 5: 3,3,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nRow 6: 3,3,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nRow 7: 3,3,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0.\n\n... and so on, adding 3s below each pair.\n\nBut let's check with the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the 7,7 pair in row 6 would generate 3s in row 7. Which matches the output.\n\nBut how to structure this correctly.\n\nApplying this pattern to the Test Input, the expected output would have 3s added in rows below the original pairs, cascading down.\n\nNow, let's try to construct the Test Input's output step by step.\n\nOriginal Test Input:\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0,0,0,0,2,9,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,8,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing pairs:\n\n1. Pair in row 1, cols 0-1 (1,1). Place 3s in the next available row below where cols 0-1 are zeros. Check row 2: cols 0-1 are 2,1 (not zeros). Check row 3: cols 0-1 are 0,0 \u2192 place 3,3. Then in row 4, cols 0-1 are 0,0 \u2192 place 3,3. Continue until bottom.\n\n2. Pair in row 1, cols 6-7 (2,9). Different numbers. Check two rows below: row 3, cols 6-7. Check if zeros. Input row 3, cols 6-7 are 0,0 \u2192 place 3,3. Then in row 4, cols 6-7 are 0,0 \u2192 place 3,3. Continue.\n\n3. Pair in row 2, cols 6-7 (1,6). Different. Check two rows below: row 4, cols 6-7: 0,0 \u2192 place 3,3. But row 4's cols 6-7 are zeros, so 3s here. Then row 5, etc.\n\n4. Pair in row 3, cols 3-4 (4,7). Different. Check two rows below: row 5, cols 3-4 \u2192 zeros. Place 3,3. Then row 6, etc.\n\n5. Pair in row 4, cols 3-4 (8,4). Different. Check two rows below: row 6, cols 3-4 \u2192 zeros. Place 3,3. Then row 7, etc.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting with the earlier assumption.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair (same or different), add 3s in the next available row below, starting from row+1. If that row's columns are non-zero, continue down.\n\nFor the 1,1 pair in row 1:\n\n- row 2: cols 0-1 have 2,1 \u2192 non-zero. Move to row 3: cols 0-1 are 0,0 \u2192 place 3,3. Then row 4: 0,0 \u2192 3,3. Row 5: 0,0 \u2192 3,3, etc., down to row 9.\n\nFor the 2 and 9 in row 1, cols 6-7:\n\n- row 2, cols 6-7: 1,6 \u2192 non-zero. Move to row 3: cols 6-7: 0,0 \u2192 3,3. Then row 4: 0,0 \u2192 3,3. etc.\n\nFor the 1 and 6 in row 2, cols 6-7:\n\n- row 3, cols 6-7: 0,0 \u2192 3,3. Then row 4: 0,0 \u2192 3,3. etc.\n\nBut since these are adjacent, their 3s would overlap.\n\nFor the 4 and 7 in row 3, cols 3-4:\n\n- row 4, cols 3-4: 8,4 \u2192 non-zero. Move to row 5: 0,0 \u2192 3,3. Then row 6, etc.\n\nFor the 8 and 4 in row 4, cols 3-4:\n\n- row 5, cols 3-4: 0,0 \u2192 3,3. Then row 6: 0,0 \u2192 3,3. etc.\n\nNow, building the output:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,0,0,0,2,9,0,0 \u2192 no changes.\n\nRow 2: 2,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0 \u2192 no changes.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,0,4,7,0,3,3,0,0 \u2192 added 3,3 in cols 6-7.\n\nRow 4: 0,0,0,8,4,0,3,3,0,0 \u2192 added 3,3 in cols 6-7.\n\nRow 5: 3,3,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,0 \u2192 added 3,3 in cols 0-1 (from row 3's 3,3), cols 3-4 (from row 3's 4,7 processed to row 5), and cols 6-7 (from row 1's 2,9 and row 2's 1,6).\n\nRow 6: 3,3,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,0 \u2192 continuing from row 5's 3s.\n\nRows 7-9: similar to row 6, but according to training examples, the 3s continue down. So each row below would have 3,3 in the respective columns.\n\nBut let's check the training examples. For Example 0, the 3s are added in rows 4,5,7,8,9 for certain columns. So perhaps after placing 3s in a row, they propagate down.\n\nPutting it all together, the Test Input's output would have:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,0,0,0,0,2,9,0,0]\n\n[2,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,4,7,0,3,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,8,4,0,3,3,0,0]\n\n[3,3,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,0]\n\n[3,3,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,0]\n\n[3,3,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,0]\n\n[3,3,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,0]\n\n[3,3,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. For example, the 3,3 in row 3's cols 6-7 would generate more 3s below. So row 4 would have 3,3 there, which they do. Then row 5 and below. Similarly, the 3,3 in row 5's cols 3-4 would continue down.\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern observed in the training examples, where 3s are added below each pair and continue to the bottom.\n\nSo the final answer should be the Test Input with 3s added in the appropriate positions as described.",
