        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern between the input and output in the training examples so I can apply it to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first training example (Example 0), the input lists have some zeros scattered. The output lists seem to have those zeros replaced. For instance, in the first input line of Example 0, the input is [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,...] and the output is all 1s. Maybe the pattern is that wherever there's a sequence of zeros in the input, those are replaced to continue the previous sequence.\n\nWait, let's look at another example. Take the second input line in Example 0: [1,2,3,0,0,1,2,3,4,5,...] and the output becomes [1,2,3,4,5,...]. So the zeros were replaced by 4 and 5? Wait, no. Let me check. The input here is [1,2,3,0,0,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3], and the output is [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3]. Oh right, so the original input had zeros at positions 3 and 4, and in the output, those zeros are replaced with 4 and 5. So maybe the zeros are filled in by continuing the sequence that was interrupted.\n\nAnother example: in Example 1, the input has [1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,0,0,0,3,1,5,3], and the output replaces those zeros with 3,1,5. Wait, the input after the zeros is 3,1,5,3. So maybe the zeros are replaced with the continuation of the previous sequence. Let's see: the part before the zeros is 1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5. Then zeros, then 3,1,5,3. The output becomes 1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3. So the zeros are replaced by the next elements in the sequence. So the pattern is that whenever there are zeros in the input, they are replaced by continuing the previous sequence as if the zeros were missing elements.\n\nSo the transformation is: each list in the input is a sequence that might have some zeros where elements are missing. The output fills in those zeros by continuing the sequence from before the zeros. So for example, if there's a sequence like 1,2,3,0,0,1,2,3..., the zeros are replaced by 4,5 because the sequence before was incrementing by 1 each time. Similarly, if the sequence is something cyclical, like 1,3,5,1,3,5... then zeros would be filled in with the next numbers in the cycle.\n\nSo how does this apply to the test input? Let's look at the first test input line: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1]. The output should replace the three zeros with 1s, because the sequence is all 1s. So the output would be all 1s.\n\nThe second test input line: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,0,0,0,8,9]. The sequence before the zeros is 1,2,3,4 (after the first 9, it starts again at 1,2,3,4). The zeros are three positions. The next elements after 4 would be 5,6,7. So the zeros would become 5,6,7, making the sequence ...4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, but the input after zeros is 8,9. So maybe after the zeros, the sequence continues from 5,6,7, then 8,9. Let's check. Original input sequence: up to 4, then zeros, then 8,9. The correct output would be 5,6,7 in place of zeros. So the output line becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].\n\nSimilarly, the third test input line: [1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,0,0,0,6,8]. Before the zeros, the sequence is 1,3,5,7 (after 8, it starts again at 1,3,5,7). Then zeros. The next elements would be 9,2,4. Because the pattern here is adding 2 each time, but after 7 comes 9 (since modulo 9 maybe?), then 2,4,6,8. Wait, maybe the cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8. So after 7, the next elements are 9,2,4. So replacing the zeros with 9,2,4, making the sequence ...7,9,2,4,6,8.\n\nThen, after the zeros in the input, there's 6,8. So inserting 9,2,4 in the zeros would make the sequence correct.\n\nSo the output for that line would be [1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8].\n\nLooking at the fourth line in the test input: [1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7]. There are no zeros here, so the output would be the same as the input. But wait, the input doesn't have zeros here. So the output is same as input.\n\nAnother test input line: [1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6]. No zeros, so output same.\n\nBut then the next line: [1,6,2,0,0,0,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,0,0,0,9,5]. Let's break this down. Before the first zeros (positions 3,4,5), the sequence is 1,6,2. Then zeros. Then 4,9,5. So the pattern here might be a cycle. Let's see. Let's check if the pattern before is adding 5 each time modulo 9? Let's see: 1, then 6 (1+5), then 2 (6+5=11 mod 9=2). Then next would be 2+5=7, then 7+5=12 mod9=3, then 3+5=8. So the sequence would be 1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5. Then it starts again at 1. So the zeros in positions 3,4,5 should be replaced with 7,3,8. Then after that, the input continues with 4,9,5. So the output line becomes [1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5]. Wait, but the input after the zeros is 4,9,5. So the zeros are replaced with 7,3,8. Then the next part is 1,6,2,7 (from the input: after zeros, the input is 4,9,5,1,6,2,7...). Wait, this might be a bit more complex. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal input line: [1,6,2,0,0,0,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,0,0,0,9,5].\n\nThe first part: 1,6,2, followed by three zeros. Then 4,9,5. Let's see the cycle. If the cycle is 1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5 (each step +5 mod 9). So after 2 comes 7, then 3, then 8, then 4,9,5. So the zeros (positions 3,4,5) should be 7,3,8. Then the next numbers are 4,9,5. Then the sequence restarts with 1,6,2,7. Then in the input after that, there's a 7,0,0,0,9,5. So the next zeros are after 7. The sequence after 7 should be 3,8,4. So replacing those zeros with 3,8,4. Then the rest would be 9,5.\n\nPutting it all together, the output line would be [1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5].\n\nAnother line in test input: [1,7,4,0,0,0,1,7,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4]. Let's see. The first part is 1,7,4, followed by zeros. Then 1,7,4. What's the pattern here? Let's check if it's a cycle. 1,7,4,1,7,4... So adding 6, then subtract 3? Wait, 1+6=7, 7-3=4, 4+6=10 mod 9=1, etc. So the cycle is 1,7,4. So zeros in positions 3,4,5 should be 1,7,4. Then the next part is 1,7,4. But the input after zeros is 1,7,4, then more zeros. So the next zeros (positions 9,10,11, etc.) would need to be filled with 1,7,4 again. But this line has a lot of zeros. So the output for this line would be [1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4].\n\nAnother line: [1,8,6,0,0,0,7,5,3,0,0,0,0,2,9,7,5,3]. Let's see the pattern. The initial numbers are 1,8,6. Then zeros. Then 7,5,3. Then zeros again. Then 2,9,7,5,3. Let's look for a pattern. Maybe 1,8,6 is 1 +7=8, 8-2=6. Then next maybe 6-7= -1 mod something? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe this is a sequence decreasing by 2 each time: 1, 8 (1+7), 6 (8-2), 4 (6-2), 2 (4-2), 0 (2-2)... but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe a cycle of 3 steps. 1,8,6, then maybe 4, 2, 0, etc. But the next numbers after the first zeros are 7,5,3. That's a decrease by 2 each time:7,5,3. Then more zeros. Then 2,9,7,5,3. Hmm. Maybe this is part of a larger cycle. Alternatively, maybe the sequence is 1,8,6,4,2,0,7,5,3,1,8,6,4,2,0,7,5,3... So the zeros in the input would be replaced by the next numbers. Let's see: the first zeros (after 1,8,6) would be 4,2,0. Then the next part is 7,5,3. Then zeros again (four zeros). The next elements after 3 would be 1,8,6,4. So replacing those zeros with 1,8,6,4. Then after that in the input, there's 2,9,7,5,3. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's check another approach. Maybe each group of three zeros is replaced by the next three numbers in the sequence. For the first part: 1,8,6 followed by three zeros. The next numbers in the input are 7,5,3. So maybe the sequence is 1,8,6, then 7,5,3, then 1,8,6, etc. But how? Alternatively, maybe the pattern is a cycle that includes 1,8,6,7,5,3,2,9,7,5,3... Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the sequence is based on adding 7, subtracting 2, etc. Alternatively, maybe it's a reverse order. Alternatively, maybe each triplet is following a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of similar examples. In Example 3, the output for sequences with 8 elements had cycles like 1,8,7,6,5,4,3,2. So perhaps in the test input, the sequence after 1,8,6 would be 4, 2, 0 (but maybe modulo 9?), but 0 is allowed. But the output in the training examples didn't include zeros. So maybe the zeros are replaced by the next numbers in the cycle. For example, in the line [1,8,6,0,0,0,7,5,3,...], the zeros would be replaced by the continuation. Let's see: 1,8,6, then the next numbers could be 4,2,0 (if subtracting 2 each step). But then the input continues with 7,5,3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, after 6, the next number is 7 (adding 1?), but then 7-2=5, 5-2=3. So maybe after 6 comes 7,5,3. But then the three zeros after 6 would be replaced by 7,5,3, which matches the next numbers. So the output would be [1,8,6,7,5,3,7,5,3...] but that doesn't fit. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the entire sequence is a cycle that repeats every certain number of elements. For example, the first test input line after 1,8,6 would need to continue the cycle. But without knowing the cycle length, it's hard to say. Let's look for the output in the training examples. For example, in Example 3, the sequence with 8 elements cycles through 1,8,7,6,5,4,3,2. So in that case, the test input line might follow a similar pattern. Let's check the test input line: [1,8,6,0,0,0,7,5,3,0,0,0,0,2,9,7,5,3]. If the cycle is 1,8,7,6,5,4,3,2, then after 1 comes 8, then 7, then 6, etc. But here, the input has 1,8,6. Hmm, maybe the cycle is different. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is a permutation. For example, 1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3. But that's a guess. Alternatively, maybe the sequence for this line is 1,8,6, 4,2,0 (but 0 isn't allowed in output), so perhaps it's mod 9. 1,8,6 (1+7=8, 8-2=6, 6-2=4, etc.), so the sequence would be 1,8,6,4,2,0,7,5,3,1,8,6, etc. But in the input, after the zeros, we have 7,5,3. So the zeros would be replaced by 4,2,0. Then the next part is 7,5,3, which would be the continuation. But 0 is not present in the output examples, as the outputs don't have zeros. So maybe in the training examples, whenever there's a 0, it's replaced by the next number in the sequence. So perhaps the sequence here is 1,8,6, then 4,2,9,7,5,3, etc. But I'm not sure. This line might be one of the more challenging ones.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to apply the pattern observed: replace sequences of zeros with the continuation of the previous sequence. So each zero in the input is replaced by the next number in the sequence that would have come next if the zeros weren't there.\n\nSo applying this to each line of the test input:\n\nFirst line: All 1s except for three zeros. Replace zeros with 1s. So output is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nSecond line: The sequence before zeros is 1,2,3,4. After that, zeros, then 8,9. The sequence should continue as 5,6,7,8,9. So replacing zeros with 5,6,7. Output line becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].\n\nThird line: The sequence before zeros is 1,3,5,7. The cycle here seems to be 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8. So after 7 comes 9, then 2,4. So zeros are replaced with 9,2,4. Output line: [1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8].\n\nFourth line: No zeros, so output same as input.\n\nFifth line: Input is [1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6]. No zeros here, so output same.\n\nSixth line: [1,6,2,0,0,0,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,0,0,0,9,5]. Let's handle each zero section. First zeros: after 1,6,2. The sequence here could be a cycle. Looking at the output for similar lines, perhaps the cycle is adding 5 each time modulo 9. So 1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5, then repeats. So after 1,6,2 comes 7,3,8. Then the next part in input is 4,9,5. So the first zeros replaced by 7,3,8. Then after 5 comes 1,6,2,7. The next zeros are after 7. So replacing those three zeros with 3,8,4. Then the input has 9,5. So the output line would be [1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5].\n\nSeventh line: [1,7,4,0,0,0,1,7,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4]. The cycle here is 1,7,4. So each set of zeros is replaced by the next elements in the cycle. The first three zeros become 1,7,4. Then the next four zeros become 1,7,4,1. Then the next three zeros would need to be 7,4,1. But the output needs to be 18 elements. Let's count:\n\nOriginal input: 1,7,4, [0,0,0], 1,7,4, [0,0,0,0], 0,0,0,0,7,4.\n\nReplacing each zero sequence:\n\nFirst three zeros \u2192 1,7,4. Then the input has 1,7,4. Next four zeros \u2192 1,7,4,1. Then the next four zeros (positions 13-16) would be replaced by 7,4,1,7. Then the input ends with 7,4. So the output would be:\n\n[1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4].\n\nWait, but the input after the first three zeros is 1,7,4. Then there are four zeros, then four zeros again. Let's see. The total length after replacement should be 18.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nOriginal input line:\n\nIndices (0-based):\n\n0:1, 1:7, 2:4, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:1, 7:7, 8:4, 9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:7,17:4.\n\nReplacing:\n\nPositions 3-5 (three zeros) \u2192 1,7,4.\n\nPositions 9-12 (four zeros) \u2192 need to continue the sequence. After the previous part (up to index 8: 4), the next elements in the cycle (1,7,4,1,7,4...) would be 1,7,4,1.\n\nThen positions 13-16 (four zeros) \u2192 after 1 (from index 12), the next elements are 7,4,1,7.\n\nSo the full output would be:\n\n[1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4].\n\nBut the input's last elements after replacement would need to fit into 18 elements. Let's count:\n\n1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4 (indices 0-8).\n\nThen next four zeros replaced by 1,7,4,1 (indices 9-12).\n\nThen positions 13-16 (four elements): after 1 (index 12), next elements are 7,4,1,7.\n\nSo indices 13:7, 14:4,15:1,16:7.\n\nThen the input has at index 16:7 and 17:4. But according to the output, index 16 would be 7 (from replacement), and index 17 is 4. So the final line would be:\n\n[1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,7,4,1,7,7,4]. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe after the first three zeros (positions 3-5) are replaced by 1,7,4, making the sequence up to index 8: 1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4. Then positions 9-12 (four zeros) are replaced by the next elements in the cycle. The cycle is 1,7,4. So after 4 (index 8), the next is 1,7,4,1. So indices 9:1, 10:7, 11:4, 12:1. Then positions 13-16 are four zeros, which would be replaced by 7,4,1,7. Then the original input's indices 16 and 17 are 7 and 4, but in the output, after replacement, indices 13-16 are 7,4,1,7, then indices 17 would be 4. But this would make the total length 18:\n\n[1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4]. But that's 18 elements. Wait, let's count:\n\n1,7,4 (3 elements)\n\nreplace 3 zeros with 1,7,4 \u2192 positions 3-5.\n\nThen positions 6-8: 1,7,4.\n\nPositions 9-12: four zeros \u2192 replaced by 1,7,4,1.\n\nPositions 13-16: four zeros \u2192 replaced by 7,4,1,7.\n\nPositions 17:4.\n\nSo total elements: 0-2:3, 3-5:3, 6-8:3, 9-12:4, 13-16:4, 17:1. Total 3+3+3+4+4+1=18. But putting it all together:\n\nIndices 0-2:1,7,4\n\n3-5:1,7,4\n\n6-8:1,7,4\n\n9-12:1,7,4,1\n\n13-16:7,4,1,7\n\n17:4\n\nSo the full array would be:\n\n1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4.\n\nWait, but that's 18 elements. Because indices 0-17:\n\n0:1\n\n1:7\n\n2:4\n\n3:1\n\n4:7\n\n5:4\n\n6:1\n\n7:7\n\n8:4\n\n9:1\n\n10:7\n\n11:4\n\n12:1\n\n13:7\n\n14:4\n\n15:1\n\n16:7\n\n17:4.\n\nYes, that makes 18 elements. So the output line would be all 1,7,4 repeating.\n\nAnother line in the test input: [1,8,6,0,0,0,7,5,3,0,0,0,0,2,9,7,5,3]. Let's try to figure this out. The sequence before the first zeros is 1,8,6. The next numbers after replacement should continue the sequence. If the sequence is based on adding 7 then subtracting 2 modulo 9, maybe. 1+7=8, 8-2=6. Then next would be 6+7=13 mod9=4, then 4-2=2, then 2+7=9. So the sequence would be 1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3, etc. So the first three zeros would be replaced by 4,2,9. Then the next part in the input is 7,5,3. Then four zeros. Following the sequence after 3:3+7=10 mod9=1, 1-2=8, 8+7=15 mod9=6, 6-2=4. So the next four elements would be 1,8,6,4. Then the input has 2,9,7,5,3. Hmm, but this seems to conflict. Alternatively, maybe the sequence is 1,8,6,7,5,3,2,9,7,5,3, etc. But I'm not sure. Given the complexity, perhaps the output line is [1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3,1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3].\n\nThe next line: [1,9,8,0,0,0,4,3,2,0,0,0,0,6,5,4,3,2]. Before the zeros, the sequence is 1,9,8. Let's see the possible pattern. 1,9,8: maybe 1 +8=9, 9-1=8, 8-4=4. Then the next numbers would be 4,3,2. Then the input has 4,3,2. Then zeros. The sequence after that would continue with 1,9,8, etc. So replacing the zeros after 2 with 1,9,8,7 (but not sure). Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is descending from 9: 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2. So after 1,9,8, the next numbers are 7,6,5. But the input after zeros is 4,3,2. This is getting complicated. Given time constraints, perhaps the zeros after 1,9,8 are replaced with 7,6,5. Then the input continues with 4,3,2. So the line becomes [1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2].\n\nBut looking at the last line of the test input: [1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2]. Which fits the pattern of a descending sequence from 9 to 2, then repeating.\n\nFinally, the last line of the test input is [1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2]. Which seems to follow the pattern of decrementing by 1 each time, restarting after 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the test output would be:\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n\n[1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8]\n\n[1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7]\n\n[1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6]\n\n[1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5]\n\n[1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4]\n\n[1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3,1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3]\n\n[1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n\n[1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8]\n\n[1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7]\n\n[1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6]\n\n[1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5]\n\n[1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4]\n\n[1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3,1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3]\n\n[1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2]\n\nI need to check if this matches the training examples' patterns.

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by carefully analyzing the training examples to understand what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input and output arrays seem to have some sequences that are periodic. For instance, in the input, the second row is [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3], and the output is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. It looks like the zeros in the input are replaced to continue the sequence. The original input might have some breaks (zeros) that are being filled in the output to maintain a repeating pattern of 1 to 5. Similarly, other rows have sequences that repeat after a certain interval, and zeros in the input are filled to continue the pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in the input rows, when there's a zero, it's replaced by the next number in the sequence. For example, in the third row of Example 0's input: [1, 3, 5, 0, 0, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 0, 0, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5], the output is [1,3,5,2,4,1,3,5,2,4,1,3,5,2,4,1,3,5]. So the zeros are replaced by continuing the sequence. The sequence here seems to be adding 2 each time modulo 5 (maybe?), but after 5, it wraps to 2, then 4, etc. So the pattern is 1,3,5, then 2,4, then repeat. So when there's a zero, they filled in the next numbers to continue the cycle.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each list is a cyclic sequence that repeats every n elements, where n is the maximum number in the sequence. For instance, in the output of Example 0, the second output row is 1-5 repeating. The third row is 1,3,5,2,4 repeating. The fourth row is 1,4,2,5,3. Then the fifth is 1,5,4,3,2. So each of these sequences has a cycle length of 5 except the first one, which is all 1s. Wait, perhaps each output row is a cyclic sequence that's built from the input by replacing zeros with the next elements in the cycle. The key seems to be that wherever there's a zero in the input, it's replaced by the continuation of the sequence.\n\nSo the transformation rule might be: For each input list, replace the zeros with the correct next elements in the cycle, based on the existing non-zero elements. The cycle length varies per list. For example, if a list is part of a cycle that repeats every m elements, then whenever there's a zero, it's filled with the next number in that cycle.\n\nBut how to determine the cycle for each list? Looking at the training examples, each output list seems to have a repeating pattern. For example, in Example 0, the first input list is [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], and the output is all 1s. So zeros are replaced by 1s here. The cycle here is just 1 repeating every 1 element.\n\nThe second input in Example 0: [1,2,3,0,0,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3]. The output is [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3]. So the cycle is 1-5, repeating. The zeros here are replaced by 4 and 5. So the input starts with 1,2,3, then zeros. The output fills those zeros with 4,5 to complete the cycle of 5 elements. Then it starts again at 1.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that each list has a certain cycle length, and the zeros are filled in such a way to continue the cycle. The problem is figuring out the cycle for each list based on the input.\n\nAnother example from Example 1's input: the second row is [1,2,3,4,5,6,1,0,0,0,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6], and the output is [1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6]. The zeros in the input are replaced by 2,3,4. So after 1, the cycle continues 2,3,4,5,6. So the cycle is 1-6, repeating. The zeros here were at positions where the next elements in the cycle would be 2,3,4.\n\nSo the transformation seems to be: For each input list, determine the cycle (the repeating sequence), and then replace any zeros in the input with the correct elements from the cycle. The cycle can be determined by looking at the non-zero elements and figuring out the repeating pattern.\n\nBut how is the cycle determined from the input? Because in some cases, the input has breaks (zeros) that need to be filled. For example, in the third row of Example 0's input: [1,3,5,0,0,1,3,5,2,4,0,0,5,2,4,1,3,5]. The output is [1,3,5,2,4,1,3,5,2,4,1,3,5,2,4,1,3,5]. So the cycle here is 1,3,5,2,4. The zeros are filled with 2 and 4 in the first case, then with 1 and 3, etc. So the cycle length is 5 elements. The cycle is [1,3,5,2,4], and it repeats every 5 elements. So the input starts with 1,3,5, then zeros. The output fills those zeros with 2,4 (the next elements in the cycle), then the next elements start again at 1,3,5, etc.\n\nSo the key steps would be:\n\n1. For each input list, determine the cycle (the sequence that is repeating).\n2. Replace any zeros in the input list with the correct elements from the cycle, continuing from the last non-zero element before the zeros.\n\nBut how to determine the cycle from the input? Since the input may have zeros, but the output is the cycle without zeros, perhaps the cycle is the longest possible repeating sequence present in the input (excluding zeros) or can be inferred by looking at the non-zero elements and their order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output list is a repetition of a base cycle. For example, the first row in Example 0's output is all 1s (cycle of 1). The second is 1-5 repeating. The third is 1,3,5,2,4 repeating. The fourth is 1,4,2,5,3. The fifth is 1,5,4,3,2. So these cycles are all of length 5 except the first. Similarly, in Example 1, the cycles are of length 6, etc.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe test input has several lists. Let's take the first test input list: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1]. The output should replace the three zeros with 1s, since the cycle here is all 1s. So the output would be all 1s.\n\nAnother test input row is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,0,0,0,8,9]. The output for this would need to replace the three zeros (positions 13,14,15) with 5,6,7, then continue. Wait, but let's look at the structure. The input after the zeros has 8,9. Wait, the sequence before the zeros is 1,2,3,4, then zeros, then 8,9. But in the output, we need to see what the cycle is. Let's look at the possible cycle. The input starts with 1-9, then 1,2,3,4. So perhaps the cycle is 1-9, repeating. So after 1,2,3,4, the next elements in the cycle are 5,6,7,8,9, then back to 1. So the three zeros would be replaced with 5,6,7. Then the 8,9 after would be part of the next cycle. So the output row would be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].\n\nWait, but in the test input, after the zeros, there's 8,9. So if the output replaces zeros with 5,6,7, then the next elements would be 8,9, which fits into the cycle. Let's check. So the input list after replacement would be:\n\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].\n\nBut in the test input, the last elements after the zeros are 8,9. So in the input, after the zeros, there's 8,9. If the cycle is 1-9, then after 7 (from replacing zeros with 5,6,7), the next elements would be 8,9, which matches the input's existing 8,9. So the output would be as I said.\n\nAnother test input row is [1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,0,0,0,6,8]. The output for this would need to replace the three zeros. Let's determine the cycle. The input starts with 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8. Then 1,3,5,7, followed by zeros. So maybe the cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8 (length 9). Then after 1,3,5,7 (positions 9-12), the next elements in the cycle would be 9,2,4. So replacing the three zeros with 9,2,4. Then the existing 6,8 would continue the cycle after that. So the output would be [1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8].\n\nBut wait, in the input after the zeros, there's 6,8. Let's see: the cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8. So after 7 (position 12), the next elements are 9,2,4,6,8. So the three zeros (positions 13-15) would be replaced with 9,2,4. Then position 16 is 6 (as in the input's 6), which is correct. Position 17 is 8. So the output list would be:\n\n[1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8].\n\nBut the input's last two elements are 6,8. So after replacing the zeros with 9,2,4, the next elements would be 6,8, which matches. So that makes sense.\n\nAnother test input row is [1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7]. This seems to be the cycle of 1,4,7 repeating. So there are no zeros here, so the output is the same as the input.\n\nBut there's another row in the test input: [1,6,2,0,0,0,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,0,0,0,9,5]. Let's see. The existing non-zero elements before the zeros are 1,6,2. So what's the cycle? Let's look at the output examples. For example, in Example 3, a similar pattern where after zeros, the cycle continues. Let's think. The input here is [1,6,2,0,0,0,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,0,0,0,9,5]. The output would replace the zeros with the next elements in the cycle. Let's see. The sequence starts with 1,6,2. Then zeros. Then 4,9,5. Then 1,6,2,7. Then zeros again. Then 9,5.\n\nHmm, perhaps the cycle here is 1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5 (cycle of 9 elements). Let me check the output of Example 3 where similar cycles occur. For example, in Example 3, there's a row with 1,6,3,8,5,2,7,4, which is a cycle. So perhaps this cycle is similar. Let's see. Suppose the cycle here is 1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5. Then after 1,6,2, the next elements would be 7,3,8. But the input has zeros here. So replacing the three zeros with 7,3,8. Then the existing elements are 4,9,5. Which would be the next elements after 8. So 4,9,5. Then after that, 1,6,2,7. Then the next three zeros would be replaced with 3,8,4. Then the existing 9,5 would follow. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input: [1,6,2,0,0,0,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,0,0,0,9,5]\n\nAfter replacing first three zeros (positions 3-5) with 7,3,8:\n\n[1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,0,0,0,9,5]\n\nThen, the next part is 4,9,5 (positions 6-8). Then 1,6,2,7 (positions 9-12). Then three zeros (positions 13-15) which should be replaced with 3,8,4. Then the existing 9,5 (positions 16-17). So the output would be:\n\n[1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5]\n\nBut the input after the zeros in positions 13-15 has 9,5. Wait, no. Let's see: in the input after replacing the zeros at 13-15 with 3,8,4, the next elements would be 9,5, but according to the cycle, after 4 comes 9,5. So after 4,9,5, the cycle starts again with 1. So maybe the entire output for this row is [1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5].\n\nBut I need to check if this fits the pattern. Let's see. The cycle would be 1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5 (length 9). Then repeating.\n\nAnother approach: look for the maximum number in the input. For example, in the test input's second row, the numbers go up to 9. So the cycle might be 1 to 9. Then each list's cycle is determined by stepping through certain intervals. Like for the first row in test input (all 1s), cycle is 1. For the second row, cycle is 1-9. For the third row, it's 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8 (steps of 2 modulo 9?), etc.\n\nAlternatively, each cycle could be determined by an increment step. For example, in Example 0's third output row, the cycle is 1,3,5,2,4. That's increments of +2, +2, -3, +2 (mod 5?), but maybe it's a different pattern. Alternatively, maybe it's related to modular arithmetic. For example, each element in the cycle is (previous + step) mod n, where n is the cycle length. But this might vary per example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cycle is constructed by starting at 1 and adding a certain step each time, wrapping around when exceeding the cycle length. For example, in Example 0's third row, the cycle is 1,3,5,2,4. The step here could be +2 each time, but mod 5. Let's see:\n\n1 +2 =3 \u21923\n3 +2=5 \u21925\n5 +2=7 \u2192 but mod 5 would be 2 (since 5 is 0 mod 5, 5+2=7 \u21927-5=2)\n2 +2=4 \u21924\n4 +2=6 \u21926-5=1 \u2192 back to 1.\n\nSo yes, this is adding 2 each time, mod 5. The cycle length here is 5. So the step is 2, cycle length 5. Similarly, in the fourth row of Example 0's output: [1,4,2,5,3], which could be adding 3 each time mod 5:\n\n1 +3=4 \u21924\n4+3=7 \u21927 mod5=2\n2+3=5 \u21925 mod5=0 \u2192 but here it's 5 (maybe treated as 5 instead of 0)\n5+3=8 \u21928 mod5=3\n3+3=6 \u21926 mod5=1.\n\nSo again, step of 3, cycle length 5.\n\nThe fifth row in Example 0 is [1,5,4,3,2], which is step of -1 each time, mod 5.\n\nSo each cycle is determined by a step and a modulus (cycle length). The cycle length seems to be the maximum number in the output sequence. For example, in Example 0's third row, the maximum is 5. The step is 2, so adding 2 each time mod 5.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation involves:\n\n1. For each input list, determine the cycle parameters (step and modulus) based on the non-zero elements.\n2. Replace zeros in the input with the correct elements from the cycle.\n\nBut how to determine the step and modulus from the input?\n\nLooking at the test input's second row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,0,0,0,8,9]. The output should be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Here, the cycle is 1-9 (mod 9, step 1). So zeros are replaced with 5,6,7.\n\nAnother row in the test input: [1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6]. The output would be the same as the input because there are no zeros. This cycle seems to be adding 4 each time modulo 9:\n\n1 +4=5\n5+4=9\n9+4=13 mod9=4\n4+4=8\n8+4=12 mod9=3\n3+4=7\n7+4=11 mod9=2\n2+4=6\n6+4=10 mod9=1.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the cycle is step 4, modulus 9.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each list in the input:\n\n- Identify the cycle's modulus (n), which is the maximum number in the output.\n- Determine the step (k) such that each element is (previous +k) mod n. However, sometimes mod n might be adjusted if the numbers go up to n and then wrap around (like in Example 0's third row, where 5 is followed by 2, which is 5+2=7 mod5=2).\n\nBut the problem is that the input has zeros, which need to be filled based on the cycle. So the algorithm would be:\n\nFor a given list:\n\n1. Ignore zeros and look for the repeating pattern in the non-zero elements.\n2. Determine the modulus (n) as the maximum number in the list (or in the output).\n3. Determine the step (k) by looking at the differences between consecutive elements.\n4. Once n and k are known, generate the cycle starting from 1, adding k each time modulo n (but if the result is 0, use n instead of 0).\n5. Replace zeros in the input list with the next elements in the cycle.\n\nBut how do we determine n and k when there are zeros in the input? Let's look at the training examples.\n\nTake Example 0's third input row:\n\nInput: [1, 3, 5, 0, 0, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 0, 0, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5]\nOutput: [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5]\n\nHere, the maximum number is 5, so n=5. The step is 2 (1\u21923\u21925\u21922 (since 5+2=7 mod5=2) \u21924 \u21921, etc.)\n\nSo step k=2, modulus n=5.\n\nThe input's non-zero elements can help determine the step. The first three elements are 1,3,5. The next non-zero after the zeros is 1,3,5 again. Then 2,4. So the step is 2. So the cycle is generated by adding 2 each time, mod 5 (but replacing 0 with 5).\n\nAnother example: Example 1's fourth input row:\n\nInput: [1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,0,0,0,3,1,5,3]\nOutput: [1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3]\n\nHere, the cycle is 1,5,3 repeating (step of +4 mod 6? Wait, 1 to 5 is +4, 5 to 3 is -2, 3 to 1 is -2. Hmm, maybe not a fixed step. Alternatively, the cycle is 1,5,3, which is three elements. So modulus 3? No, because the maximum is 5. Alternatively, perhaps this is a cycle of length 3, but the numbers are 1,5,3. So maybe the modulus is 5, but the step isn't fixed. This complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps some cycles are not based on a fixed step. For example, in Example 1, the fourth output row is [1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3]. The cycle here is 1,5,3. So this is a cycle of length 3. But how is this determined from the input? The input has 1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,0,0,0,3,1,5,3. The zeros are in the middle. The output replaces the zeros with 3,1,5. So after 1,5, the next elements are 3,1,5,3. So the cycle is 1,5,3 repeating.\n\nSo perhaps the cycle is determined by the non-zero elements in the input, and when there's a break (zeros), they are filled based on the existing pattern.\n\nSo another approach is to look for the longest possible repeating subsequence in the input's non-zero elements. For example, in the input [1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,0,0,0,3,1,5,3], the non-zero elements are 1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,5,3. The repeating subsequence here is 1,5,3. So the cycle is that three-element sequence.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm could be:\n\n1. For each input list, process the elements and ignore zeros.\n2. Find the minimal repeating subsequence (cycle) in the non-zero elements.\n3. Use this cycle to fill in the zeros in the input, continuing the sequence from where it left off.\n\nSo, for example, if the input has a cycle of 1,2,3,4,5 and there's a zero in the middle, it's replaced by the next element in the cycle.\n\nBut how to find the minimal repeating cycle in the presence of zeros? This might require analyzing the non-zero elements and finding the shortest repeating pattern.\n\nThis seems complex, but looking at the training examples, the output cycles are often the same as the non-zero parts of the input, but with the zeros filled in. So perhaps the process is to take the non-zero elements, determine the cycle they form, and then fill the zeros accordingly.\n\nFor the test input's row [1,7,4,0,0,0,1,7,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4], the output would need to fill the zeros. The non-zero elements are 1,7,4,1,7,4,7,4. The cycle here could be 1,7,4 (each step adding 6 mod 9? Because 1+6=7, 7+6=13 mod9=4, 4+6=10 mod9=1). So the cycle is 1,7,4. Then the zeros would be filled with the next elements. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input: [1,7,4,0,0,0,1,7,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4]\n\nAfter the first 1,7,4 comes three zeros. The next elements in the cycle would be 1,7,4. So replacing the zeros with 1,7,4. Then comes 1,7,4 (from input). Then the next zeros (positions 9-15) are seven zeros. The cycle after 4 would be 1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7. So replacing the seven zeros with these. But this might depend on the cycle length. Let's see:\n\nCycle is 1,7,4 (length 3). So after 4, the next elements are 1,7,4, and so on.\n\nSo the input list after replacement would be:\n\n[1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4]\n\nBut the existing elements after the first zeros are 1,7,4 (positions 6-8), then zeros from 9-15. So replacing those zeros with 1,7,4,1,7,4,1. Then the existing elements 7,4 (positions 16-17) are part of the cycle. So the full output would be the cycle 1,7,4 repeated six times (since 18 elements divided by 3 gives exactly six repetitions). So the output is [1,7,4] repeated six times.\n\nBut wait, the input's last two elements are 7,4. So after replacing all zeros, the entire list would be six repetitions of [1,7,4], which is 18 elements. Hence, the output would be all cycles.\n\nSo applying this to each test input row:\n\nFor each row:\n\n1. Remove the zeros and identify the cycle from the non-zero elements.\n2. Fill the zeros in the original input with the next elements from the cycle.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input rows:\n\nFirst row: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1]\n\nNon-zero elements are all 1s. So the cycle is [1]. Replace zeros with 1s. Output is all 1s.\n\nSecond row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,0,0,0,8,9]\n\nNon-zero elements are 1-9 followed by 1,2,3,4,8,9. But wait, the input has 1,2,3,4, then zeros, then 8,9. The cycle here should be 1-9. So the zeros should be replaced with 5,6,7. The existing 8,9 after the zeros are correct. So the output is 1-9 repeated twice, which gives 18 elements.\n\nThird row: [1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,0,0,0,6,8]\n\nNon-zero elements are 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8, then 1,3,5,7,6,8. The cycle here seems to be 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8 (step +2 mod 9). So replacing the three zeros with 9,2,4. Then 6,8 are next in the cycle. So the output would be two full cycles of 1-8 with step 2.\n\nFourth row: [1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7]\n\nNo zeros. Output is the same as input.\n\nFifth row: [1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6]\n\nNo zeros. Output same as input.\n\nSixth row: [1,6,2,0,0,0,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,0,0,0,9,5]\n\nNon-zero elements are 1,6,2,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,9,5. The cycle here seems to be 1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5 (step +5 mod 9). Let's see: 1+5=6, 6+5=11 mod9=2, 2+5=7, 7+5=12 mod9=3, 3+5=8, 8+5=13 mod9=4, 4+5=9, 9+5=14 mod9=5, 5+5=10 mod9=1. So the cycle is length 9: 1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5. \n\nThe input has 1,6,2, then zeros, followed by 4,9,5, then 1,6,2,7, then zeros, then 9,5.\n\nFirst zeros (positions 3-5) should be replaced with 7,3,8. Then the next part is 4,9,5. Then 1,6,2,7. Next zeros (positions 13-15) should be replaced with 3,8,4. Then 9,5. The output would be:\n\n[1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5]\n\nSeventh row: [1,7,4,0,0,0,1,7,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4]\n\nAs discussed earlier, the cycle is 1,7,4. Replacing all zeros with the next elements:\n\nThe input is:\n\nPositions 0-2: 1,7,4\n\nZeros 3-5: replaced with 1,7,4.\n\nPositions 6-8: 1,7,4 (input).\n\nZeros 9-15 (7 zeros): replaced with 1,7,4,1,7,4,1.\n\nPositions 16-17:7,4.\n\nSo the output is:\n\n[1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4]\n\nEighth row: [1,8,6,0,0,0,7,5,3,0,0,0,0,2,9,7,5,3]\n\nNon-zero elements: 1,8,6,7,5,3,2,9,7,5,3. Let's see. The cycle could be 1,8,6,3, ... but this is unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's a step of -3 mod 9. Let's check:\n\n1 -3 = -2 \u2192 7 mod9? Not sure. Alternatively, the cycle might be 1,8,6,3, etc. But it's a bit unclear. Looking for a pattern:\n\n1,8,6,7,5,3,2,9,7,5,3. Maybe the cycle is 1,8,6,3, 1,8,6,3... but the presence of 7,5 complicates this. Alternatively, maybe the cycle is 1,8,6,3, 1,8,6,3, etc. But this doesn't fit. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the cycle is determined by the output of Example 3, which had similar steps. For example, in Example 3's test input, some cycles involve steps that wrap around higher numbers. \n\nAlternatively, the cycle here is 1,8,6,3,9,7,5,2,4 (step of -2 mod 9):\n\n1 \u21921-2= -1 mod9=8 \u21928-2=6 \u21926-2=4 (but in the input we have 3 here). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different step. Let's look at the input's non-zero sequence: 1,8,6,7,5,3,2,9,7,5,3. This seems a bit erratic. Alternatively, perhaps the cycle is 1,8,6,3,9,7,5,2,4 (step of -2 each time but mod9). Let's see:\n\n1 \u21928 (step -3?), 8\u21926 (step -2), 6\u21923 (step -3), 3\u21929 (step +6), 9\u21927 (step -2), 7\u21925 (step -2), 5\u21923 (step -2), 3\u21922 (step -1?), not sure. This is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle is not based on a fixed step but is a permutation. For example, in Example 3's output, there's a row [1,8,7,6,5,4,3,2], which is step of -1. So perhaps this test input row has a cycle of step -2. Let's check:\n\n1, then 8 (1+7), 6 (8-2), 3 (6-3), 9 (3+6), 7 (9-2), 5 (7-2), 3 (5-2), 1 (3-2). No, this doesn't form a clear cycle. Maybe this row is more complex. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the non-zero elements: after 1,8,6, the next non-zero is 7. So the sequence so far is 1,8,6,7. Then 5,3,2,9,7,5,3. Not sure. Maybe the cycle is 1,8,6,3,9,7,5,2,4 (but how?). Alternatively, maybe this is a cycle of length 9, and the step is -3 mod9.\n\n1-3= -2 \u21927 mod9 \u21928 (since 9-2=7, but no). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for the output of similar examples.\n\nIn Example 3's test input, there's a row [1,8,7,6,5,4,3,2], which is step -1. But this test input row is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle is 1,8,6,7,5,3,2,9,4, which doesn't form a clear pattern. Maybe it's better to look for the longest repeating subsequence in the non-zero elements.\n\nThe non-zero elements are: 1,8,6,7,5,3,2,9,7,5,3.\n\nLooking for repeating patterns: 7,5,3 appears at the end. Earlier, we have 7,5,3 in positions 6-8 (7,5,3). Then again at positions 13-15 (but those are zeros). So perhaps the cycle is 7,5,3. But this doesn't explain the beginning. Alternatively, the cycle might be 1,8,6,3,9,7,5,2,4. But without more data, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, considering the test input's eighth row:\n\nInput: [1,8,6,0,0,0,7,5,3,0,0,0,0,2,9,7,5,3]\n\nThe output should replace the zeros with the next elements in the cycle. Let's assume the cycle is 1,8,6,3,9,7,5,2,4 (step of -2 mod9):\n\n1 \u21921-2=8 \u21928-2=6 \u21926-2=4 \u2192 but the next non-zero is7. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the cycle is 1,8,6,7,5,3,2,9,4 (steps varying). But this is not a fixed step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle is derived from the non-zero elements. The first part of non-zero elements is 1,8,6, then 7,5,3, then 2,9,7,5,3. This suggests that the cycle might be 1,8,6,7,5,3,2,9,4. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps it's better to look for the maximum number in the input and assume a cycle of that length. For this row, the maximum is 9, so the cycle length is 9. Let's assume the step is -2 (each step subtracts 2 modulo9). \n\n1-2=8 (mod9: 1-2= -1 \u21928)\n8-2=6\n6-2=4\n4-2=2\n2-2=0 \u21929 (since 0 is replaced with9)\n9-2=7\n7-2=5\n5-2=3\n3-2=1.\n\nSo the cycle would be 1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3. Then repeating.\n\nBut the input's non-zero elements are 1,8,6,7,5,3,2,9,7,5,3. This doesn't fit the cycle I just described. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle is 1,8,6,3,9,7,5,2,4. Let's see:\n\n1\u21928 (step +7)\n8\u21926 (step -2)\n6\u21923 (step -3)\n3\u21929 (step +6)\n9\u21927 (step -2)\n7\u21925 (step -2)\n5\u21923 (step -2)\n3\u21922 (step -1)\n2\u21924 (step +2). \n\nThis isn't a fixed step, so it's not a simple arithmetic progression. This makes it difficult to determine the cycle.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the test input and replace the zeros based on the maximum number in the row and a step that fits the existing non-zero elements. For example, in the eighth row of the test input, the maximum is 9. Let's assume the cycle is 1,8,6,3,9,7,5,2,4 (step of -3 mod9):\n\n1 \u21921-3= -2 \u21927 \u21928? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle is 1,8,6,3,9,7,5,2,4, but this requires more detailed analysis. Given the time constraints and the need to provide an answer, perhaps the best approach is to generate the output by following the examples' patterns, focusing on replacing zeros with the next elements in the cycle, determined by the non-zero parts.\n\nIn any case, applying the pattern observed in the training examples to the test input:\n\nEach row in the test input needs to have its zeros replaced with the correct elements to complete the repeating cycle observed in the non-zero parts. Based on the training examples, the output rows are the input rows with zeros filled in to continue the cycle without interruption.\n\nNow, generating the output for each test input row:\n\n1. [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1] \u2192 All 1s. Output: [1 repeated 18 times]\n\n2. [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,0,0,0,8,9] \u2192 Cycle 1-9. Replace zeros with 5,6,7. Output: 1-9 repeated twice.\n\n3. [1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,0,0,0,6,8] \u2192 Cycle 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8. Replace zeros with 9,2,4. Output: two cycles.\n\n4. [1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7] \u2192 No zeros. Output same as input.\n\n5. [1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6] \u2192 No zeros. Output same.\n\n6. [1,6,2,0,0,0,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,0,0,0,9,5] \u2192 Cycle 1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5. Replace zeros with 7,3,8 and 3,8,4. Output: two cycles.\n\n7. [1,7,4,0,0,0,1,7,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4] \u2192 Cycle 1,7,4. Replace zeros to repeat cycle.\n\n8. [1,8,6,0,0,0,7,5,3,0,0,0,0,2,9,7,5,3] \u2192 This one is tricky. Assume the cycle is 1,8,6,3,9,7,5,2,4. Replace zeros accordingly. But without clear information, perhaps the output is [1,8,6,3,9,7,5,2,4,1,8,6,3,9,7,5,2,4].\n\n9. [1,9,8,0,0,0,4,3,2,0,0,0,0,6,5,4,3,2] \u2192 Cycle 1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2. Replace zeros to complete the cycle. Output: 1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2.\n\n10. [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 All 1s. Output same.\n\n11. [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] \u2192 No zeros. Output same.\n\n12. [1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8] \u2192 No zeros. Output same.\n\n13. [1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7,1,4,7] \u2192 Output same.\n\n14. [1,0,0,0,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6] \u2192 Zeros replaced with 5,6,7. Assuming the cycle is 1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6. So input starts with 1, followed by zeros which should be 5,9,4. Then 8,3,7,2,6. Then 1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6. So output is [1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9,4,8,3,7,2,6].\n\nBut the input after zeros has 8,3,7,2,6. Which fits the cycle. So replacing the initial zeros with 5,9,4.\n\n15. [1,0,0,0,3,8,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5] \u2192 Assuming cycle is 1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5. Zeros replaced with 6,2,7. So output is [1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5].\n\n16. [1,0,0,0,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4] \u2192 Cycle is 1,7,4. Replace zeros with 1,7,4. Output: [1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4,1,7,4].\n\n17. [1,0,0,0,2,9,7,5,3,1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3] \u2192 Cycle is 1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3. Replace zeros with 8,6,4. Output: [1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3,1,8,6,4,2,9,7,5,3].\n\n18. [1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2] \u2192 No zeros. Output same.\n\nNow, compiling all these into the output format as per the examples.",
