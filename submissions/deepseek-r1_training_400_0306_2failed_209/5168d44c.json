        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is transformed into an output. My job is to find out what transformation is happening and apply it to the test input.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 2s and 3s arranged in a certain way. The output seems to shift those blocks. For instance, in the third row of input, it's [2,2,2,0,...], and the output shifts those 2s two positions to the right. Similarly, the fourth row in the input is [2,3,2,3,0,3,...], and in the output, this becomes [0,3,2,3,2,3,...], so again a shift. It looks like each non-zero cluster is shifted left or right? Wait, in example 0's output, the 2s in the third row start at index 2 instead of 0. Wait, original third row is [2,2,2,0...], output third row is [0,0,2,2,2,0...]. So that's a shift to the right by two positions? Or maybe centered?\n\nWait, the original third row has three 2s starting at index 0. The output has them starting at index 2, so shifted right by two. But in the fourth row, the input starts with 2,3,2,3,0,3, etc., and the output starts with 0,3,2,3,2,3... So the first element (2) is replaced by 0, and the next elements shift. Maybe it's not a simple shift. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has a structure with some 3s and 2s. The output moves some rows. For instance, the input has a section with 2,2,2 in the fourth, fifth, sixth rows. In the output, those are moved down by two rows. The original rows 3,4,5 (assuming 0-based) become rows 5,6,7. So maybe the pattern is that certain blocks are shifted vertically and/or horizontally. But how to determine which blocks?\n\nAnother observation: In example 0, the 2s and 3s form a diamond-like structure. The output seems to shift parts of that structure. Maybe the transformation is mirroring or rotating? Or perhaps moving the center of the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is moving each non-zero element in a certain direction based on their position. For instance, maybe shifting elements to the right or left in a way that the entire structure is shifted, but only the non-zero parts. Wait, in example 0's third input row, shifting right by two positions. The fourth row in input has elements that start at index 0 (2), and in output, it's index 1 (3). So perhaps each row is shifted in a certain way. But the shifting might not be uniform across all rows.\n\nLooking at example 2: The input has a structure where there are three 2s forming a horizontal line in rows 1,2,3. The output moves those rows down by one. So input rows 1,2,3 (0-based?) become output rows 3,4,5. Wait, the input's rows are:\n\nInput rows (example 2):\n\n[0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,3,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,3,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n[0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the input's rows 1,2,3 (the 2s and 3s) are moved to rows 3,4,5 in the output. The original rows 1,2,3 become rows 3,4,5. So they are shifted down by two rows. Then the 3s in rows 0, 4, 6 are left as is except for adding some zeros in between. So maybe the transformation is moving the central block (the 2s and 3s) down by two rows. Similarly, in example 1, the input's central block (rows 3,4,5) are moved down to rows 5,6,7.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the central block (the largest cluster of non-zero numbers) is shifted downward by a certain number of rows. Let me check example 0. In example 0, the input's non-zero rows are rows 2,3,4 (0-based). In the output, they become rows 2,3,4. Wait, no shift. Hmm, that contradicts the earlier idea.\n\nWait, example 0's input has non-zero rows at rows 2,3,4 (0-based):\n\nRow 2: [2,2,2,0,...]\nRow3: [2,3,2,3,0,3,...]\nRow4: [2,2,2,0,...]\n\nIn the output, these rows are shifted. Wait, looking at the output:\n\nRow2: [0,0,2,2,2,0...] \u2192 same as input row2 but shifted right by 2 positions.\nRow3: [0,3,2,3,2,3...] \u2192 original row3 starts with 2,3,2,3... output starts with 0,3,2,3...\nSo shifted right by 1 position.\nRow4: [0,0,2,2,2,0...] \u2192 shifted right by 2 positions.\n\nSo maybe each row in the central block is shifted right by an amount that depends on their position. For example, row2 shifted by 2, row3 shifted by 1, row4 shifted by 2 again. That's inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the entire structure is shifted to the right, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the entire structure is shifted down and to the right. Wait, in example 0, the input's rows 2,3,4 (central part) are shifted to the same rows but shifted to the right. So maybe it's a horizontal shift but no vertical shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is flipping the structure. For example, example 0's input has a diamond-like shape. The output seems to have the same structure shifted to the right. So maybe it's a mirror image or rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element is moved in a certain direction. For instance, moving 2s and 3s to the right by a certain number of positions. But the number varies per example.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the test input. The test input has a central row (row 3) with [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], then row4 has 3s and 2s, and row5 again 2s. So the structure is similar to example 0's input, which had a diamond shape. The output for example 0 had that structure shifted right. So maybe the test input's structure (rows 3,4,5) would be shifted right by two positions, perhaps.\n\nWait, in example 0's input, row3 is [2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0]. The output row3 is [0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0]. So the first element (2) is replaced by 0, then the next elements are shifted. So maybe the shift is not uniform. Alternatively, the entire row is shifted right by one, causing the first element to become 0 and the rest shifted, but perhaps with some overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each row is shifted right by the row index modulo something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero cluster is moved to the center. For example, in example 0, the input's 2s and 3s are in the first few columns, and the output centers them. Let's check the lengths. The input rows have 13 elements. The central position would be index 6. In example 0's input row3, the non-zero elements start at index 0. In output row3, they start at index 1 (3). Maybe the center is at index 6, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is shifted to the right by one or two positions to center it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire structure is shifted such that the central element (if any) is centered in the row. For example, in example 0's row3, the original elements are 2,3,2,3,... which could form a pattern around index 0, but in the output, they are shifted so that the 3 is at index 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the vertical shifts. For example, in example 1, the input's central block (rows 3,4,5 with 2s and 3s) are moved down by two rows in the output. The output's rows 5,6,7 correspond to the input's rows 3,4,5. So that's a vertical shift of +2. Then, in example 2, the central block (rows 1,2,3) are moved to rows 3,4,5, which is a vertical shift of +2. So maybe the transformation is moving the central block down by two rows. But why in example 0, the central block (rows 2,3,4) remains in the same vertical positions but shifted horizontally.\n\nHmm, this inconsistency complicates things. Let's check example 0 again. Input rows 2,3,4 have non-zero elements. Output rows 2,3,4 also have non-zero elements. So vertical position is the same. So maybe the vertical shift applies only when the block is not in the middle of the grid. But example 0's input has 7 rows. Middle row is row 3. The non-zero rows are 2,3,4, so surrounding the middle row. So perhaps in that case, the vertical position doesn't change, but horizontal shift is applied. In examples 1 and 2, where the block is higher up, it's shifted down by two rows.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to \"drop\" the blocks as far down as possible, similar to how blocks fall in Tetris. So in example 1, the 2s and 3s in rows 3,4,5 (input) would fall down to rows 5,6,7 (output) if there's space below. Let's check. In example 1's input, after the central block, there are rows below (rows 6 to 12) that are mostly zeros except for some 3s. So if the block can't fall further, maybe they shift down until they hit non-zero elements. But in example 1's output, the block is moved down to rows 5,6,7, which were originally zeros. So maybe the blocks are moved down as much as possible.\n\nWait, in example 1's input:\n\nRows 3,4,5 (0-based) are:\n\n[0,0,0,2,2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,2,3,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,2,2,2,0]\n\nBelow them (rows 6 to 12) have some 3s but in other columns. So the rows 6-12 have 3s in column 4, but the block is in columns 3-5. So there's space to move the block down. So moving down two rows would place them in rows 5,6,7. Which is what the output shows.\n\nIn example 2's input, the block is in rows 1,2,3. Below that, row4 is [0,0,3,0...], which may not interfere. So moving down two rows would take them to rows 3,4,5, which matches the output.\n\nIn example 0's input, the block is in rows 2,3,4. If moving down two rows would take them to rows 4,5,6, but row5 and 6 are zeros. However, in the output, they remain in rows 2,3,4. So this contradicts the \"falling down\" idea. Unless there's a different rule. Maybe the blocks are shifted down if they are not in the central part of the grid, but in example 0, they are already in the middle and thus not shifted. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical shift is applied to blocks that are not centered. So in example 1 and 2, the blocks are higher up, so they are shifted down. In example 0, the block is centered, so it's shifted horizontally. So maybe the transformation is to center the blocks both vertically and horizontally. For example, in example 0, the horizontal shift centers the 2s and 3s. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's row3 in input: starts at index 0. Output row3 starts at index 1 (3), then 2,3,2,3... which could be centered. For a 13-element row, the center is index 6. The original row3 in example 0 starts with 2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0. The output starts with 0,3,2,3,2,3... So the 3s and 2s are shifted right by one position. But the center would be index 6. Let's see: in the output row3, the elements at index 1 is 3, index2 is 2, index3 is3, index4 is2, etc. Maybe not centered. So that might not fit.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for symmetry. The output might be mirroring the input. For example, in example 0, row3 input is [2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0], output is [0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0]. If you reverse the input row3, you get [0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2], which is not the same as the output. So maybe not a simple mirror.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that each non-zero element is shifted right by one position, but in a cyclic manner. But in example0's row3 input starts with 2,3,2,3..., output starts with 0,3,2,3... So the 2 is replaced by 0, and the next elements are shifted. So perhaps the shift is right by one, but the first element becomes 0. So like a right shift, losing the first element and adding 0 at the end. Wait, for example, input row3: [2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0]. Shifting right by one would give [0,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3], which doesn't match the output. The output row3 is [0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0]. So the first element is 0, then 3, which is the second element of the input. So perhaps a shift right by one but starting from index 1. So the output is the input shifted right by one, then the first element is set to 0. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to shift each non-zero cluster to the right by one position, but only if there are zeros to the right. For example, the three 2s in example0's row2 are shifted right by two positions to make room for zeros. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at example0's row2 input: [2,2,2,0...] \u2192 output [0,0,2,2,2...]. So that's a shift of two positions to the right. So in this case, the 2s are moved two positions to the right. How about row3? Input starts with 2,3,2,3... output starts with 0,3,2,3... So shifted right by one. Row4: [2,2,2...] \u2192 shifted right by two again. So the shifts vary per row.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is such that the first non-zero element in a row is preceded by two zeros. For example, row2 input starts at index0, output starts at index2. So two zeros before. Row3 input starts at index0, output starts at index1. One zero before. So inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is determined by the row's position. For example, row2 is shifted two, row3 shifted one, row4 shifted two again. Maybe based on alternating shifts. But how would that apply to other examples.\n\nLooking at example1's output. In the input's rows3,4,5 (the block), in the output they are moved down to rows5,6,7. So a vertical shift of two. But what about horizontally? For example, in example1's row3 input is [0,0,0,2,2,2,0], output row5 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], then row6 is [0,0,0,2,2,2,0]. Wait, no. The output's rows5,6,7 are:\n\n[0,0,0,2,2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,2,3,2,0]\n\n[0,0,0,2,2,2,0]\n\nWhich are the same as the input's rows3,4,5. So they are shifted down by two rows. So the horizontal positions remain the same. So maybe the vertical shift is moving the block down by two rows, and the horizontal shift applies to example0's case.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is: if a block is in the middle vertically, shift it right; if it's higher up, shift it down.\n\nBut how to determine when to shift vertically or horizontally. Alternatively, the transformation is that each \"layer\" of the structure is shifted in a certain direction. For example, the outermost layer is shifted down, inner layers shifted right, etc. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the entire structure is rotated 90 degrees. But looking at example0's input and output, that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the position of the 3s, which are probably the center of the structures. In example0's input, the 3 is at (3,1) [row3, column1]. In the output, it's at (3,1). So no vertical shift. But horizontal shift. Wait, original row3 had 2 at (3,0), 3 at (3,1). Output row3 has 0 at (3,0), 3 at (3,1). So the 3 remains in the same column. The 2s around it are shifted. So perhaps the structure is expanded to the right. For example, the original diamond shape is shifted right, making the 3 stay in place but the 2s shifted.\n\nAlternatively, the structure is shifted such that the 3 is centered. For example, in example0's input row3, the 3 is at column1. The output row3 has the 3 at column1, but the 2s are arranged more to the right. Maybe to balance the structure.\n\nAlternatively, each 2 is moved right by one position, and 3s stay. So in example0's row3 input: 2,3,2,3... becomes 0,3,2,3... So the first 2 is gone, replaced by 0, the 3 stays, the next 2 moves right by one. But that might not hold for other examples.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to create a mirror image around the center column. For example, in example0, the input's row3 starts with 2,3,2,3... and the output's row3 starts with 0,3,2,3... The mirror of the input's row3 would be 0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,2. Which doesn't match the output. So probably not.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to shift each row to the right by (row index modulo 2) positions. For example, even rows are shifted by two, odd rows by one. But in example0, row2 (index2) is shifted by two, row3 (index3) shifted by one, row4 (index4) shifted by two. So if modulo 2, row2 (even) is shifted two, row3 (odd) shifted one. But why those numbers?\n\nAlternatively, in example0, the central row (row3) is shifted right by one, and the rows above and below (rows2 and4) are shifted right by two. So maybe for each layer around the center, the shift increases. But how does this apply to other examples.\n\nIn example1's output, the shifted rows (5,6,7) have the same horizontal positions as the original rows3,4,5. So no horizontal shift, just vertical.\n\nIn example2's output, the shifted rows (3,4,5) have the same horizontal positions as the original rows1,2,3. So again no horizontal shift, just vertical shift down by two.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: For any contiguous block of non-zero rows that are not in the middle of the grid, shift them down by two rows. If they are in the middle (like example0), shift them right by one or two positions.\n\nBut how to define the middle. For example0's input has 7 rows, so the middle is row3. If the block is centered on row3, then shift horizontally. Otherwise, shift down.\n\nBut this is a bit vague. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest input has 7 rows. The non-zero rows are rows3,4,5. So rows3 is the middle row (since 7 rows, 0-based, row3 is the fourth row). So according to example0's pattern, perhaps this block should be shifted horizontally.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the structure is similar to example0's, with a diamond-like shape. The output would then shift each row in this block to the right. For row3, which is [2,2,2] in the middle, perhaps shifted right by two positions. So the 2s would start at index 8 instead of 7. For row4, the elements are [3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. If shifted right by one, the first element (3) would become 0, then the rest shift. So the 3s would start at index 1, but the 2 and 3 would shift. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example0's row4: input [2,2,2,0...] \u2192 output shifted right by two. So maybe the test row3 and row5 would shift right by two. Row4 would shift right by one.\n\nLet's try to apply that to the test input.\n\nTest input row3 (original): indices 7,8,9 are 2,2,2. Shifting right by two would make them start at index9. So the row would become:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the length is 17 elements. So indices 7,8,9 shifting to 9,10,11. So row3 would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4 in test input: [3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. Shifting right by one would mean each element moves right by one, first becomes 0. So the row becomes:\n\n[0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0]\n\nBut how does this compare to example0's row3 transformation? Example0's row3 input was [2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0], output became [0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0]. So shifted right by one. Similarly, test input row4 would shift right by one.\n\nRow5 of test input is similar to row3, so shifting right by two.\n\nBut let's see. If the test input's rows3,4,5 are shifted in the same way as example0's rows2,3,4, then:\n\nRow3: shift right by two \u2192 starts at index9.\n\nRow4: shift right by one.\n\nRow5: shift right by two.\n\nBut I need to see what the expected output would look like.\n\nAlternatively, the entire diamond structure is shifted right by two positions. For example, row3's 2s are moved from 7,8,9 to 9,10,11. Row4's elements would be shifted right by two as well. But example0's row3 was shifted right by one. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the block is shifted right by (row's position relative to the middle row). For example, the middle row (row4 in the test input) is shifted right by one, and the rows above and below (rows3 and5) are shifted right by two.\n\nSo for test input:\n\nRow3: shift right by two \u2192 2s start at index9.\n\nRow4: shift right by one \u2192 elements start at index8.\n\nRow5: shift right by two \u2192 2s start at index9.\n\nThen, the new structure would have:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,...]\n\nRow4: [0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,...]\n\nThis would create a diamond shape shifted to the right.\n\nBut how does this compare to example0's output?\n\nIn example0's output, row3 has the 3s and 2s shifted right by one. So perhaps this is the pattern.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nOriginal rows3,4,5:\n\nRow3: ...2,2,2...\n\nRow4: ...2,3,2...\n\nRow5: ...2,2,2...\n\nShifting row3 and row5 right by two, row4 right by one.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\nRow3: all zeros except 2,2,2 starting at index9.\n\nRow4: 3s shifted right by one, so the first 3 is at index0, which becomes 0, then 3s follow. So the row becomes [0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0].\n\nRow5: shifted right by two, 2s start at index9.\n\nThen the other rows remain zeros.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis seems plausible. Comparing to example0's output, which has shifted the 2s right and adjusted the 3s similarly.\n\nThus, the final answer would be:\n\nEach row in the central block (rows3,4,5) is shifted right by two positions for the top and bottom rows (rows3 and5), and shifted right by one position for the middle row (row4). The other rows remain zeros.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is transformed into an output. My job is to find out how the input is being changed to get the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 2s and 3s arranged in a certain way. The output seems to shift some elements. For instance, the third row in the input is [2,2,2,0,...], and the output shifts those 2s two positions to the right. Similarly, the fourth row in input has 2,3,2,3,... and the output shifts them one position to the right. Wait, maybe it's not a shift. Let me check again. In Example 0's input row 3, the elements are [2,3,2,3,0,3,...], and in the output it's [0,3,2,3,2,3...]. So the entire row is shifted right by one, but the first element becomes 0. But looking at the other rows, maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps it's about moving certain patterns. Like, in Example 0, the input has a structure that looks like a diamond made of 2s and 3s. The output shifts that diamond to the right. Similarly, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s and a horizontal structure of 2s and 3s. The output moves that horizontal structure down a few rows. For example, in the input, the horizontal 2s are in rows 3,4,5 (0-indexed?), and in the output, they are moved to rows 5,6,7. So maybe the pattern is moving certain clusters downward or rightward.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a cross-shaped structure with 3s and 2s. The output seems to split that cross into separate lines. The vertical line of 3s in the middle is separated into different rows, and the horizontal 2s are moved. Wait, the input's rows 1,2,3 have the 2s forming a horizontal line, and in the output, those rows are shifted down. Like, in the input, row 1 is [0,2,2,2,0...], and in the output, row 3 becomes that. So maybe the pattern is that certain blocks of numbers are moved down by two rows, and then the surrounding rows are filled with zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is rotating or reflecting. Let's see. In Example 0, the structure in the input is a diamond shape. The output's structure is shifted to the right. So maybe each row is shifted to the right by a certain number of positions. But the shifts vary per row. For example, the third row in the input (index 2) is shifted right by 2 positions. The fourth row (index 3) is shifted right by 1. The fifth row (index 4) is shifted right by 2 again. Hmm, maybe the shift depends on the row's position. Like, even rows are shifted by 2, odd by 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the layers of the structure. For example, in Example 0, the diamond is made of 2s and 3s. The output shifts the entire diamond to the right. So perhaps the transformation is moving the central part of the structure to the right. How does this apply to other examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s and a horizontal block of 2s and 3s. The output moves the horizontal block down a few rows. So maybe the pattern is that certain structures (like 2s and 3s clusters) are moved downward or rightward, and the rest of the rows are filled with zeros. But how to determine which clusters to move?\n\nLooking at the third example, Example 2. The input has a cross: a vertical line of 3s and a horizontal line of 2s. The output splits them into separate parts. The horizontal line (rows 1,2,3) is moved down to rows 3,4,5. The vertical line is split into separate rows with 3s. So maybe the transformation is shifting certain rows down, causing the structure to separate.\n\nPutting this together, perhaps the pattern is that each contiguous block of non-zero elements (like 2s and 3s) is shifted down by two rows and to the right by two columns. But how to verify?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the third row (index 2) in input is [2,2,2,0,...]. The output row 2 is [0,0,2,2,2,...]. So shifted right by two positions and same row. Wait, no shift down. Then the fourth row in input (index3) is [2,3,2,3,0...], output row3 is [0,3,2,3,2...], so shifted right by one. Hmm, this isn't consistent. Maybe it's a different approach.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the pattern involves mirroring or flipping. For example, reflecting the non-zero elements. In Example 0's row3 input is [2,2,2,...], output row2 is [0,0,2,2,2...], which is a right shift. The row4 input is [2,3,2,3...], output is [0,3,2,3,2...], so a right shift by one. Similarly, row4 in input (index3) shifts right by one, row2 and 4 (indices 2 and 4) shift right by two. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is shifted right by (row index) mod some number. Let's check:\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow 2 (index 2) input: [2,2,2,...], output shifted by 2 positions. So index 2 mod 3 is 2. Maybe shift by 2.\n\nRow 3 (index3) shifted by 1. 3 mod 3 is 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, rows with non-zero elements are shifted. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking for the position of the non-zero elements. For example, in Example0's input, the non-zero elements start at column0 in row2. In the output, they start at column2. So shifted right by 2. Similarly, in row3, non-zero elements start at column0, and in output, start at column1. So shifted right by 1. Row4's input starts at column0, output starts at column2. So shifted right by 2. So perhaps even rows (assuming rows are 0-based) get shifted by 2, odd rows by 1? But row3 is index3 (odd?), shifted by1. Row2 and 4 (even indices) shifted by2. That seems to fit. But then in Example1, let's see.\n\nIn Example1's input, the rows with 2s and 3s are rows3,4,5 (indices3,4,5). Let's look at their output. In output, these rows are now rows5,6,7. So shifted down by 2 rows. Also, their elements are shifted right by some amount. Let's check:\n\nInput row3 (index3) is [0,0,0,2,2,2,0]. Output row5 is [0,0,0,2,2,2,0], same position. Wait, no shift. But in the output, the entire block of 2s and 3s (rows 5,6,7) is shifted down two rows from the input's rows 3,4,5. So perhaps the vertical shift is two rows down. But in Example0, the rows with non-zero elements (rows2,3,4) in input are shifted down? Let's check. Input rows2,3,4. Output rows2,3,4. So no vertical shift there. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the transformation is that each 'layer' of the structure is moved. For example, in Example0, the input has a diamond shape. The output's diamond is shifted to the right. Maybe each diamond layer (like the 2s and 3s) is shifted right, and the 3s are in the center. But how to determine the shift.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that the entire structure is shifted right by one column and down by one row. But in Example0, the structure is in rows2-4. The output's structure is in rows2-4, but shifted right. So maybe not a vertical shift here. But in Example1, the structure shifts down. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's input and output. The input has a group of 2s and 3s in rows3-5 (0-based). The output moves this group down to rows5-7. So two rows down. But the other 3s in the input (like the vertical line) are spread out and in the output, some are shifted. Maybe the group of 2s and 3s that form a solid block (like the horizontal lines) are moved down by two rows, while isolated 3s remain in place. But how to determine which clusters to move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row contains a 3, then it's left as is. But if it contains 2s, it's shifted down or right. But in Example0's row3 has 3s and 2s. The output shifts the entire row right by one. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for how the 3s are treated. In Example0, the 3s are in row3, and in the output, they remain in row3 but shifted right by one. In Example1, the 3s in the vertical line are in various rows and stay in the same positions, but the 3s in the horizontal block (row4) are moved down. Wait, in the input of Example1, the row4 (0-based) is [0,0,0,2,3,2,0]. The output's row6 is [0,0,0,2,3,2,0]. So that row is shifted down two rows. Similarly, rows3 and5 in input (the ones with 2s) are shifted down two rows in the output. So the cluster of 2s and 3s (the horizontal part) is moved down two rows, and the vertical 3s remain in their original rows. So maybe the pattern is that any contiguous block (like a horizontal line of 2s and a 3 in the middle) is shifted down by two rows, while individual 3s remain in place. So in Example0, the rows2-4 form a diamond shape. So maybe the middle row (row3) is shifted right by one, and the rows2 and4 are shifted right by two. That would align with Example0's output.\n\nIn the Test Input, the input has a structure in rows3-5. Let's see. The middle row (index4) is [3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. The rows3 and5 are [0,0,...,2,2,2,...0], and [0,...2,2,2,...0]. So in the input, rows3 and5 have a horizontal line of 2s, and row4 has 3s and 2s. If the pattern is to shift the horizontal 2s (rows3 and5) down two rows, then rows3 and5's 2s would move to rows5 and7. But the Test Input has only 7 rows (indices 0-6). Wait, the test input is 7 rows. So row3 in input (index3) is shifted down two rows would be row5 (index5). But row5 in the input is already part of the structure. Hmm.\n\nWait, the Test Input has:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo rows3 and5 have horizontal 2s. According to the pattern in Example1, those rows (with 2s) would be shifted down by two rows. But in the Test Input, the rows are:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\n0: all zeros\n\n1: zeros\n\n2: zeros\n\n3: 2,2,2 in the middle\n\n4: 3s and 2s\n\n5: 2,2,2\n\n6: zeros\n\nSo shifting rows3 and5 down two rows would move row3 to row5, and row5 to row7. But the Test Input only has 7 rows (indices 0-6). So row5 can't be shifted to row7. So maybe the shift is by one row instead. Or perhaps the Test Input's rows3 and5 are part of a larger structure, and need to be shifted down. But how?\n\nAlternatively, in the Test Input, the rows3,4,5 form a structure similar to Example0's diamond. The middle row (row4) has 3s and 2s. The rows3 and5 have 2s. So perhaps the transformation is to shift row3 and5's 2s to the right, and shift row4's elements to the right by one.\n\nIn Example0's row3 (input), the elements are [2,3,2,3,0,3...], and output shifts right by one. So for the Test Input's row4, which is similar (3s and 2s in a pattern), shifting right by one would make the first element 0, then 3,0,3, etc.\n\nBut looking at the Test Input's row4: [3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. Shifting right by one would make it [0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0], but maybe that's not the exact pattern. Wait, maybe in the Test Input, the 2s in rows3 and5 are shifted right by two, and the 3s and 2s in row4 are shifted right by one.\n\nSo applying that to the Test Input:\n\nRow3 input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] shifted right by two \u2192 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. But in Example0, the row2 input (shifted right by two) became [0,0,2,2,2,0,...]. So yes, shifting right by two. So row3 in Test Input would become [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow5 input: same as row3, so shifted right by two to become same as above.\n\nRow4 input: [3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. Shifting right by one would make it [0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. Wait, but the original row4 has 17 elements. After shifting, the first element becomes 0, and the rest shift right. So the new row would be [0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0]. But the last element (original 3) would be cut off? Or perhaps it's shifted, but since the row length is fixed, the last element is dropped. Wait, the original row4 has 17 elements. Shifting right by one would add a 0 at the start and truncate the end by one. So the output row4 would be [0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0].\n\nBut in Example0's row3, after shifting right by one, the elements start with 0, then 3, etc. So the same pattern here.\n\nPutting this together, the Test Input's output would have:\n\nRow3: shifted right by two \u2192 zeros followed by 2,2,2 further right.\n\nRow4: shifted right by one \u2192 starting with 0, then 3,0, etc.\n\nRow5: shifted right by two \u2192 same as row3.\n\nBut what about the vertical positioning? In Example0, the rows2,3,4 were shifted in place. But in the Test Input, if we shift rows3,4,5 right, but not down, then the structure remains in rows3-5. However, looking at the Test Input's structure, after shifting, the 2s in rows3 and5 would be moved to the right, and the 3s in row4 would also shift. So the output would have:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the original rows3 and5 are now shifted right, and row4 is shifted right by one.\n\nBut also, perhaps the vertical positions are shifted down. For example, in Example0, the diamond structure is in the same rows (2-4), but shifted right. In Example1, the horizontal block is shifted down two rows. But how does this apply to the Test Input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire structure is shifted right and down. But in the Test Input's case, the structure is in rows3-5. Shifting down by two would move them to rows5-7, but there are only 7 rows (0-6). So rows5-7 would be out of bounds. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Test Input's structure is similar to Example0, where the middle row (row4) is shifted right by one, and the rows3 and5 are shifted right by two. So the structure remains in the same rows but shifted right.\n\nTherefore, the Test Input's output would be:\n\nRows3 and5 shifted right by two, row4 shifted right by one.\n\nSo, for the Test Input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nAfter shift right by two: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]\n\nAfter shift right by one: [0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,3,0]\n\nRow5: same as row3, shifted right by two.\n\nThen, the rest of the rows remain zeros.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut wait, the Test Input has 7 rows. So row6 is all zeros. The original rows3-5 become rows3-5 in the output, but shifted. So the output rows3 is the shifted row3, row4 shifted, row5 shifted.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. Let me check the examples again to see if this pattern holds.\n\nIn Example0, the middle row (row3) was shifted right by one, and rows2 and4 shifted by two. So the same as here.\n\nIn Example1, the horizontal block (rows3-5) were shifted down by two rows, but in the Test Input, we're not doing that. Wait, but maybe the pattern is different based on the structure's shape. For instance, horizontal lines are shifted down, while vertical or diamond structures are shifted right. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any row with a sequence of 2s (like three 2s in a row) are shifted right by two, and rows with 3s and 2s (like alternating) are shifted right by one. So in the Test Input's rows3 and5 (2s in a row), shifted right two. Row4 (alternating 3s and 2s) shifted right one. That matches Example0's pattern.\n\nYes, that seems plausible. So applying that to the Test Input, the rows with three 2s (rows3 and5) are shifted right by two. The row with 3s and 2s (row4) is shifted right by one. The other rows remain zeros.\n\nSo the final output would be as described earlier.",
