        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see what's changing from the input to the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is:\n[3, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nThe output becomes:\n[8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nHmm, the first row has 3 and 2 turning into 8. 3 + 2 = 5, but 8 is higher. Wait, maybe it's 3 + 5 (from the third row's 5) but that's 8? Wait, the 5 is in the same column as the 2. Let me check positions. The 3 is in position 0,0 and 2 is in 0,1. The 5 is in 2,1. So maybe adding adjacent numbers? But how?\n\nWait, in the output, the 8 is in position 0,0. The original 3 and 2 are there. 3+2=5, but 8 is the sum. Maybe there's another number involved. Wait, the 5 is in the same column as the 2. So maybe vertically adjacent? Or perhaps the sum of all non-zero numbers in adjacent cells (including diagonals?)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell is replaced by the sum of all non-zero numbers in its row and column, except itself? Not sure. Let's look at another example.\n\nExample 1 input has a lot of rows. Let's take the second input row: [0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0], which becomes [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]. So the 3 and 2 in positions 2 and 3 are summed to 5, but output is 8. Wait, where does the 8 come from? Let's check other rows. The fourth input row is [0,2,0,0,0,0], which becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0]. So maybe the 2 in position 1 here is contributing to another row. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the third row input is [0,3,0,0,0,2], which becomes [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So here, the 3 and 2 in the same row? 3+2=5 again, but output is 8. Wait, maybe it's the sum of adjacent numbers in the same column from other rows. Let's see: in example 1's third row, the 3 is in position (3,1). Let's check if any numbers are below or above it. The fourth row (row 4) has a 2 in position (4,1). So 3 + 2 =5, but output is 8. Doesn't add up. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell is replaced by the sum of all the non-zero numbers in the same column. Let's check example 0. The first column has 3, 0, 0. Sum is 3. But output is 8. That doesn't fit. Second column has 2, 0,5. Sum is 7. Not 8. Third column is 0s. So maybe not that.\n\nAnother approach: in example 0, the 3 and 2 in the first row become 8. 3+2=5, but 8 is 3+2+5 (the 5 is in the same column as the 2, which is row 2, column 1). So 3 (0,0) + 2 (0,1) +5 (2,1) = 10. Not 8. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of all non-zero numbers in the same row and column, but not including itself. For example, in example 0's first row, 3 and 2. The 3's column (column 0) has only 3. The 2's column (column 1) has 2 and 5. So 3 (from row 0, column 0) plus 2 and 5 (from column 1). 3+2+5=10. No, output is 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that are non-zero. For example 0's first row, 3 is at (0,0). Adjacent cells are right (2), and down (0). So 2. Then 2 at (0,1) has left (3), down (0), right (0). So sum 3. But 3+2=5. Not 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at example 2's input and output. Let's see. In the third row of input example 2, there's [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which stays the same. But in the input's second row [5,0,2,3,0,0,0], the output becomes [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So the 2 and 3 in positions 2 and 3 of that row are replaced with 8. So 2+3=5. How to get 8? Maybe sum of non-zero elements in some adjacent cells. Let's check the cells around 2 (row 2, column 2). Up is row1, column2: 0. Down is row3, column2:0. Left is row2, column1:0. Right is row2, column3:3. So for the 2, adjacent non-zero is 3. For the 3 (row2, column3), adjacent non-zero: left is 2, right is 0, up is row1, column3:0, down is row3, column3:0. So sum of 2 and 3 is 5. But output is 8. So that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair of adjacent non-zero numbers in a row are summed and replaced. For example, in example 0, 3 and 2 are adjacent, so 3+2=5. But output is 8. Hmm.\n\nWait, 3 and 2 in the first row. 3+2=5. Then maybe multiplied by something. 5 *1.6 =8? That seems arbitrary. Not likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of all numbers in the same row and column. For example, in example 0, the first row's 3 is in column 0. Sum of column 0 is 3 (since other rows are 0). The 2 is in column 1, which sums to 2+5=7. So 3+7=10. Not 8.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is replacing certain cells with the sum of their neighbors in the same row. For instance, in example0, the first row has 3 and 2. The next non-zero in the row is none. So sum is 3+2=5. But output is 8, so maybe including some other elements.\n\nWait, maybe it's looking for the first occurrence of a non-zero followed by another non-zero in the same row, and summing them, replacing the first with the sum and the second with zero. For example, in example0, first row [3,2,0]. The first two elements are non-zero. Sum 3+2=5. But output is 8. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of all consecutive non-zero numbers in the row. Like, if there are consecutive non-zero numbers, add them all and put the sum in the first position, zeros elsewhere. For example, in example0's first row, [3,2,0] would become [5,0,0]. But the output is [8,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the sum is not just within the row. Let's look at example1's input. The second row becomes [0,0,8,0,0,0]. The original numbers there are 3 and 2. If we look in other rows, maybe the column for 3 (column2) and 2 (column3). Let's see what's in those columns.\n\nIn column2, the input has 3 in row1, 0 in row2, 0 in row3, 0 in row4, 0 in row5, 0 in row6. So sum is 3. Column3 has 2 in row1, 0 in row2, 0 in row3, 0 in row4, 3 in row5 (original input row5 is [5,0,0,3,0,0]). Wait, no. Wait, the input for example1 is:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,3,2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,3,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow4: [0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [5,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo in row1, columns2 and 3 are 3 and 2. Then in column2, there's 3 (row1), 0 (row3), 0 (row5), so sum is 3. In column3, there's 2 (row1), 0 (row3), 3 (row5). Sum is 5. So 3+5=8? So maybe for row1, columns2 and 3, the sum of their column sums? 3 (column2) +5 (column3) =8. That would explain why it's 8. Then in the output, row1's third element becomes 8, and the fourth (2) becomes 0. So perhaps the rule is: for any consecutive non-zero elements in a row, sum the totals of their respective columns, replace the first with the sum, and the others with zero.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with example0. The first row has 3 and 2. Column0's sum is 3 (only in row0). Column1's sum is 2+5=7 (rows0 and 2). So 3+7=10. But output is 8. Doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another angle. In example1's output row3, the original input was [0,3,0,0,0,2]. The output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. The 3 is replaced by 8, and the 2 remains. So 3 is in column1. What's the sum of column1? In the input, column1 has 0 (row0), 0 (row1), 0 (row2), 3 (row3), 2 (row4), 0 (row5), 0 (row6). Sum is 3+2=5. So 5, but output is 8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the current cell and all adjacent cells (including diagonally) that are non-zero. Let's check example0's first cell (3). Adjacent cells are right (2), down (0). So sum is 3+2=5. Output is 8. No. What if the sum of all non-zero cells in the entire grid? That seems unlikely, but example0's grid sum is 3+2+5=10. Output's sum is 8+5=13. Not matching.\n\nWait, looking at example1's input row5: [5,0,0,3,0,0] which remains the same in the output. So perhaps the pattern isn't applied there. So maybe the transformation is applied only to certain rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for cells that are followed by non-zero cells in the same row. For example, if a cell is non-zero and has a non-zero cell immediately to the right, sum them into the first cell and set the next to zero. But in example0, 3 and 2 are next to each other, sum to 5, but output is 8. So maybe there's more to it. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum is of all consecutive non-zero elements in the row, but their values are multiplied by their positions. Or maybe the sum is multiplied by the number of elements summed. Like 3+2 =5, multiplied by 2 (since two elements) gives 10. No, output is 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the numbers plus their product. 3+2 + (3*2)=5+6=11. Not 8.\n\nHmm. Let's think of example2's input and output. In the input row5: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the 3 and 2 in the first two positions are replaced by 8, and the 3 in position5 is replaced by 8. So for the first two, 3+2=5, but output is 8. For the last 3, maybe 3+ something. Wait, the original input row5 is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. Output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the 3 and 2 in positions0 and1 are replaced with 8. The 3 in position5 is replaced with 8. How?\n\nMaybe each pair of consecutive non-zero elements in a row is summed. For example, in row5, 3 and 2 are consecutive, sum to 5. But output is 8. Then the 3 in position5 (after zeros) becomes 8. Maybe it's the sum of their column totals. Let's check columns for example2.\n\nIn example2, the input row5 is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. Columns for these elements:\n\nColumn0: 3 (row5). Other entries: row0 has 0, row1 has3, row2 has5, row3 has0, row4 has0, row5 has3, row6 has0. So column0 sum is 3+3+5=11. Column1: 2 (row5). Other entries: row1 has0, row2 has0, row5 has2, row6 has0. Sum is 2. Column5's 3 is in column5. Column5 sum: row0 has2, row1 has0, row2 has0, row4 has2, row5 has3. Sum is 2+2+3=7. \n\nIf we sum column0 (11) and column1 (2), that's 13. Not 8. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the current element and the next non-zero in the row, but also considering the next non-zero in the column. For example, in example0, 3 and 2 are in the same row, and 2's column has 5. So 3+2+5=10. Not 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that when two non-zero numbers are adjacent in a row, they are replaced by their sum, and this process is applied left to right. But then example0's first row would become 5,0,0. But the output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe there's a diagonal component. Let's look at example0's first row. The 3 (0,0) and 2 (0,1) are replaced by 8. The 5 is at (2,1). So 3 + 5 = 8. But what about the 2? Maybe the 3 is combined with the 5 diagonally. But how? The 3 is at (0,0), the 5 is at (2,1). They are not adjacent. So 3+5=8. Then why is the 2 (0,1) set to zero? Because maybe the 5 is in the same column as the 2. So the 2 is replaced by zero, and the 3 is replaced by 3+5=8. That could be possible.\n\nIn example0, 3 (0,0) and 5 (2,1) sum to 8. So maybe the rule is: for each non-zero element, look diagonally down to the right (or some direction) for another non-zero element. If found, sum them, replace the first with the sum, and set the other to zero.\n\nWait, in example0, the 3 is at (0,0). Diagonally down-right would be (1,1), which is 0. But the 5 is at (2,1). So if looking down two rows? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each cell, if there's a non-zero cell directly below it (same column), sum them. In example0's column1, 2 (0,1) and 5 (2,1). Sum is 7. But output is 8. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for the next non-zero in the same column. For example, 3 in (0,0) has no non-zero below it. So maybe that's not it. The 2 in (0,1) has 5 below in (2,1). So sum 2+5=7. But output in (0,0) is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern involves combining adjacent non-zero numbers in the same row, but also including numbers from the next row in the same column. Like, for example0, 3 and 2 are in the same row. Then, in the column of 2 (column1), there's a 5 in row2. So the sum is 3+2+5=10. But output is 8. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the first two non-zero in the row and the first non-zero below in any column. For example, in example0's first row, the two non-zeros are 3 and 2. Below 2 is 5. So 3+2+5=10. Not 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the numbers in the same row and the same column. For example, for the first row's 3 (0,0), sum all elements in row0 and column0. Row0 has 3+2=5, column0 has 3. Total 8. Because 5+3=8. Wait, row0's sum is 3+2=5. Column0's sum is 3. 5+3=8. That fits the first output cell. Let's check that.\n\nIn example0's output, first cell is 8. Row0's input sum is 5, column0's sum is 3. 5+3=8. So that works. What about other examples.\n\nTake example1's second row input [0,0,3,2,0,0]. The output changes the 3 and 2 to 8 and 0. So the row sum here is 3+2=5. Column2's sum: in input, column2 has 3 (this row) and 0 elsewhere. So column sum is3. 5+3=8. Which matches the output's 8. Then the third element becomes 8. Yes.\n\nAnother example: example1's third row input [0,3,0,0,0,2] becomes [0,8,0,0,0,2]. The row sum here is 3+2=5. Column1's sum is 3 (from this row) and 2 (from row4). So column sum is 5. Row sum (5) + column sum (5) =10. But output is 8. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. So maybe this theory is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the row and the column where the cell is located. Let's check example0's first cell. The row sum is 5, column sum is3. So 5+3=8. Correct. For the second cell in example0's row0, which is 2, the row sum is5, column sum is2+5=7. 5+7=12. But the output is 0. So that theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell is replaced by the sum of the row and column for that cell. For example, row0, column0: row sum is5, column0 sum is3. 5+3=8. So correct. Row0, column1: row sum5, column sum7. 5+7=12. But output is0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell is replaced by the sum of all the elements in its row and all the elements in its column, but excluding itself. Let's try example0's first cell (3). Row sum without 3 is 2. Column0 sum without 3 is0. So 2+0=2. Not 8. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's try example2's row5 input [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. Output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. For the first element (3), row5's sum is3+2+3=8. Column0's sum in input is row0:0, row1:3, row2:5, row5:3. Sum is3+5+3=11. So 8+11=19. Doesn't match output 8. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the elements in the same row up to that cell. For example0, row0 has 3 and2. Sum is5. Output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each pair of consecutive non-zero numbers in a row is replaced by their sum, and this process is repeated until there's only one number in the row. But in example0, that would sum 3+2=5, but output is8. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being replaced by the sum of all the non-zero numbers in their \"cross\" (row and column). For example, for a cell at (i,j), sum all non-zero in row i and column j, then subtract the cell's own value (since it's counted twice). Let's check example0's first cell (3). Row0 sum is5. Column0 sum is3. Total sum:5 +3 -3 (since 3 is counted in both) =5. Output is8. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's look at example2's output. In row5 of the output, the first and sixth elements are 8. The original elements were 3 and 2 (positions0 and1), and 3 (position5). So maybe each 3 is replaced by 8. But in example0, 3 and2 become8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, 3+2+3=8? No, that's 8. But in example0, 3+2=5. No. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are added and multiplied by something. Like, 3+5=8 (example0's 3 and 5 in column1). But where does the 5 come from? Oh, in example0's third row, column1 is5. So maybe for the first row, column1 has 2 and 5. So 2+5=7. 3+7=10. Not 8.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output contains numbers that are sums of certain numbers in the input, but the way they are summed is not straightforward.\n\nIn example0, the 8 in the first position. The input has 3, 2, and 5. 3+2+5=10. Not 8.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum value in the row and column. For example0's first cell: row max is3, column max is3 (since column0 has3). So max is3. Output is8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the row and column sums. For example0's first cell: row sum5, column sum3. 5*3=15. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the row's non-zero elements and the column's non-zero elements. For example0's first cell: row sum5, column sum3. 5+3=8. Yes! That matches. So 3+2=5 (row sum) and 3 (column sum) gives 8. Let's test this with other examples.\n\nExample1's second row input has 3 and2. Their row sum is5. Column2's sum: in input, column2 has3 (this row) and0 in others except row5 has3. Wait, example1's input has row5's column3 as3. Wait, column2 for example1's input:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nSo column2's sum is3. So row sum5 (3+2) + column sum3 =8. Which matches the output of8 in that cell. Then, the next cell (3, column3) in example1's row1 is2. The row sum is5, column3's sum is2 (from this row) +3 (row5) =5. So 5+5=10. But in the output, this cell is0. So this theory seems to only apply to the first non-zero element in a consecutive sequence. Or perhaps it's applied to the first element in a consecutive pair, and the second is set to zero.\n\nWait, in example1's row1, the non-zero elements are3 and2. If we process them from left to right:\n\nFirst element is3. Row sum for this row is5 (3+2). Column sum for column2 is3. So 5+3=8. Replace 3 with8 and set 2 to0. That's what the output shows. Then, for the next element (2), since it's now zero in the output, perhaps it's skipped. So the rule could be: for each row, for each consecutive pair of non-zero elements, replace the first with the sum of the row's non-zero elements plus the column sum of the first element's column, and set the second element to zero.\n\nWait, let's test this with example0. The row's non-zero elements are3 and2. Sum is5. Column sum for3's column (column0) is3. So 5+3=8. Replace3 with8, set2 to0. Which matches the output. For example1's row1, sum is3+2=5. Column for3 (column2) sum is3. So 5+3=8. Replace3 with8, set2 to0. Which matches. \n\nThen in example1's row3: input is [0,3,0,0,0,2]. Sum of row is3+2=5. The 3 is in column1. Column1's sum is3 (row3) +2 (row4) =5. So 5+5=10. But output is8. So this doesn't fit. Hmm. Wait, maybe the column sum is the sum of the entire column except the current element. So for row3's 3 in column1, column1's sum is3 (row3) +2 (row4) =5. Excluding current element (3), sum is2. So row sum5 + column sum2=7. Not 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the row sum is just the sum of the consecutive pair, not the entire row. For example, in example1's row3, the non-zero elements are3 and2, but they are not consecutive. Wait, in row3's input, the elements are [0,3,0,0,0,2]. So 3 is at position1 and 2 is at position5. Not consecutive. So the rule might only apply to consecutive non-zero elements in the row.\n\nAh! That's a key point. So in example0, the consecutive non-zero elements are3 and2. In example1's row1, consecutive non-zero elements are3 and2. In example2's row5, consecutive non-zero elements are3 and2 in positions0 and1, and then 3 in position5 (not consecutive). \n\nSo the rule could be: For each consecutive pair of non-zero elements in a row, sum their values and add the sum of the entire column of the first element. Then replace the first element with this total, and set the second to zero.\n\nWait, let's test this with example0. The pair is3 and2. Sum of pair is5. Column of first element (3) is column0, which sums to3. So 5+3=8. Which matches. \n\nIn example1's row1, the pair is3 and2. Sum is5. Column of3 (column2) sum is3. So 5+3=8. Replace3 with8, 2 with0. Correct.\n\nIn example1's row3: the non-zero elements are3 and2 but not consecutive. So no action. So the 3 is in column1. Column1's sum is3+2=5. So the row sum for the entire row is5 (3+2). But since they are not consecutive, perhaps the rule doesn't apply. Hence, the output is8 for the 3. How?\n\nWait, the output for row3 in example1 is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the3 is replaced by8. The2 remains. So maybe the rule is applied even to single non-zero elements if they are not part of a consecutive pair. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is applied to each individual non-zero element: replace it with the sum of all elements in its row plus the sum of all elements in its column. But for example0's first element3, row sum is5 (3+2), column sum3. 5+3=8. Which fits. The 2 in column1: row sum5, column sum7 (2+5). 5+7=12. But output is0. So why is it zero?\n\nAh! Because in example0's row0, the3 and2 are consecutive. So the rule is applied to the first element (3) by adding row sum and column sum, and the second element (2) is set to zero. So for consecutive pairs, only the first is processed, and the rest are zeroed. For non-consecutive non-zero elements, perhaps each is replaced by row sum + column sum.\n\nBut in example1's row3, the3 is replaced by8. Let's check. Row3's sum is3+2=5. Column1's sum is3+2=5. So 5+5=10. But output is8. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the row sum is just the current element's value, and column sum is the entire column. So for example0's3: row sum is3 (its own value) + column sum3 (column0's sum) =6. But output is8. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the row sum is the sum of the current element and the next element (if consecutive), then add the column sum of the current element.\n\nSo for example0's first element3 and next element2 (consecutive), row sum pair is5. Column sum for3's column (0) is3. So 5+3=8. Then set the next element to0. That works.\n\nFor example1's row3, the3 is not consecutive with the2. So perhaps row sum is just3 (its own value), column sum is5 (3+2). So 3+5=8. Which matches the output. Ah! So maybe the rule is:\n\nFor each non-zero element in the row:\n\n- If it is followed by a consecutive non-zero element, sum the pair, add the column sum of the first element's column. Replace the first with this sum, set the second to zero.\n\n- If it is not followed by a consecutive non-zero element, sum the element's value and its column sum, and replace it with that sum.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nIn example0's row0:\n\n3 is followed by2 (consecutive). Sum pair:5. Column sum of3's column (0) is3. 5+3=8. Replace3 with8, set2 to0. Correct.\n\nIn example1's row1:\n\n3 is followed by2 (consecutive). Sum pair:5. Column sum of3's column (2) is3. 5+3=8. Replace3 with8, set2 to0. Correct.\n\nIn example1's row3, the3 is not followed by a consecutive non-zero. So sum its own value (3) and column sum of column1 (3+2=5). 3+5=8. Replace3 with8. Correct. The2 in the same row is not consecutive to anything, so sum its value (2) and column sum of column5 (2's column is5). Column5's sum is2 (from row3) +0 (others). So 2+2=4. But the output leaves it as2. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So example1's row3, the2 remains as2. So the rule must not apply to all non-zero elements. It seems that the rule is applied only to consecutive pairs. But then how does the3 in example1's row3 get replaced with8?\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe for each consecutive pair of non-zero elements in a row, replace the first with the sum of the pair plus the sum of the first's column, and the second with zero. For elements that are not part of a consecutive pair, leave them as is.\n\nBut in example1's row3, the3 is not part of a consecutive pair. So why is it replaced with8?\n\nAh, perhaps there's another part to the pattern. Maybe elements that are followed by a non-zero element in the same column below them. For example, in example0's3 and5. Or in example1's row3's3: there is a2 in row4, column1. So 3+2=5. Not 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the element and the first non-zero element below it in the same column. For example0's3 has nothing below in column0. So stays 3. No. But output is8. So no.\n\nAlternatively, for the element in example1's row3, column1 (3), there's a2 in row4, column1. So 3+2=5. Output is8. So not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at all the examples, the outputs have certain cells replaced with the sum of some numbers. Let's list all the changes:\n\nExample0:\n\nInput row0: [3,2,0] \u2192 Output [8,0,0]\n\nSo 3+2 becomes 8, and 5 remains.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput row1: [0,0,3,2,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nInput row3: [0,3,0,0,0,2] \u2192 [0,8,0,0,0,2]\n\nExample2:\n\nInput row2: [5,0,2,3,0,0,0] \u2192 [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nInput row5: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nNoticing that in each case, when two consecutive non-zero elements are in a row, they are replaced by a single number which is their sum plus the sum of the first's column. Wait, in example0's case, the first element's column sum is3 (column0). Their sum is5. 5+3=8. \n\nIn example1's row1, the first element's column sum is3 (column2). Their sum is5. 5+3=8.\n\nIn example2's row2, the consecutive pair is2 and3. Sum is5. Column of2 is column2. Column2's sum: in example2's input, column2 has2 (row2), 0 (others?), so sum is2. 5+2=7, but output is8. Hmm, doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example2's row2 input is [5,0,2,3,0,0,0]. The consecutive pair is2 and3. Sum is5. Column2's sum: looking at all rows in input for column2:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nSo column2's sum is2. So 5+2=7, but output is8. So that's not matching.\n\nThis theory fails here. So perhaps the column sum is different. Wait, example2's column3 for row2's3. Column3's sum: in input, column3 has3 (row2), 0 (row0), 0 (row1), 0 (row3), 0 (row4), 0 (row5),5 (row6). Sum is3+5=8. So if the sum of the pair (2+3=5) plus column3's sum (8) equals13. No. Output is8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the column sum is the sum of the column where the pair is located. For example, in example2's row2, the pair is2 and3. They are in columns2 and3. Sum of columns2 and3: 2+3 (their own values) plus column2 sum (2) and column3 sum (8). No, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pair is summed, then multiplied by the number of non-zero elements in their columns. For example, example0's3 and2. 3's column has1 non-zero, 2's column has2. So (3+2) * (1+2) =5*3=15. Not 8.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace each pair of consecutive non-zero numbers with their sum and the sum of the first number's column. For example, in example0, 3 and2 are consecutive. Sum is5. Column sum for3's column is3. So 5+3=8. That works.\n\nIn example1's row1, 3 and2: sum5. Column sum for3's column (column2) is3. 5+3=8.\n\nIn example2's row2, 2 and3 are consecutive. Sum5. Column sum for2's column (column2) is2. 5+2=7. But output is8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this works for the first two examples but not the third. What's different in example2's row2?\n\nIn example2's output, the pair (2,3) becomes8. So 5+3=8. Wait, 2+3=5, but 5+3=8. Where does the3 come from? Maybe the column sum of one of the elements. Column2's sum is2, column3's sum is3+5=8 (3 from row2, 5 from row6). So 5+3=8? Or 5+ (column3's sum)=5+8=13. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the pair plus the sum of the column of the second element. For example2's row2 pair (2,3): sum5 + column3's sum8=13. No. Output is8.\n\nThis is perplexing. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe all numbers that are part of a consecutive pair in their row are summed and replaced by 8, while isolated numbers remain. But 3 and2 sum to5, not8. So that's not it.\n\nWait, looking at example2's row5: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. The first pair (3,2) becomes8, the isolated3 becomes8. So maybe after processing consecutive pairs, any remaining non-zero elements are also replaced by8. But why? \n\nAlternatively, the sum is the sum of the element and the element directly below it. For example, in example0's first row,3 is at (0,0), below it are zeros. No. But the2 is at (0,1), below it is5 at (2,1). 2+5=7. Not8.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the element and the next non-zero element in the same column, regardless of row. For example,3 in example0's row0, column0: no non-zero below, so remains3. But output is8. So no.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to look for another approach. Maybe the output cells are the sum of all non-zero numbers in their row and column. For example, in example0's first cell:\n\nRow0 non-zero:3,2 \u2192 sum5.\n\nColumn0 non-zero:3 \u2192 sum3.\n\nTotal 5+3=8.\n\nWhich matches. For example0's second cell (originally2):\n\nRow0 sum5.\n\nColumn1 sum2+5=7.\n\n5+7=12. But output is0. So no.\n\nBut perhaps this is only applied to the first element of consecutive pairs. So for the first element, sum row and column, and set the second to zero. For example0's first cell: row sum5, column sum3 \u21928. Correct.\n\nExample1's row1: sum of row is3+2=5. Column sum for3's column is3. 5+3=8. Correct.\n\nExample1's row3:3's row sum is3+2=5. Column sum for3's column is3+2=5. 5+5=10. But output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the row sum is only the pair's sum, not the entire row. So in example0's row0, pair sum is5. Column sum3. 5+3=8. Correct.\n\nExample1's row3:3 is not part of a pair. So what's the sum? Maybe just3. Column sum for column1 is3+2=5. 3+5=8. Which matches the output. So perhaps the rule is: for each non-zero element in the row, if it is the first in a consecutive pair, replace it with the sum of the pair plus the column sum of the first element's column. If it's a single non-zero (not part of a pair), replace it with its own value plus its column sum.\n\nIn example1's row3, the3 is single. So 3 + column1's sum (3+2=5) =8. Correct.\n\nThe2 in row3, column5 is a single non-zero. So 2 + column5's sum (2's column5 sum is2 (from row3) +3 (row5's column5) =5. So 2+5=7. But output leaves it as2. So this doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is applied only to consecutive pairs, and single non-zero elements remain unchanged. But example1's row3's3 is changed to8, which is not a pair. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: For each consecutive pair of non-zero elements in a row, replace the first with the sum of the pair plus the sum of the first element's column. For any single non-zero element that is followed by at least one non-zero element in the same column, replace it with the sum of its value plus the sum of its column.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Let's think of example2's row5. The input is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. Output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0].\n\nThe first pair (3,2) becomes8. The3 in column5 becomes8. So maybe for each non-zero element, if there's a non-zero element in the same column below, sum the element's value and the column's sum. For example,3 in column0 (row5): what's the column0 sum. In example2's input, column0 has:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:3\n\nRow6:5\n\nSo column0 sum is3+5+3+5=16. Then 3 +16=19. But output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the element is in a column with other non-zero elements, sum them. For example,3 in row5, column0. Other non-zeros in column0 are3 (row1),5 (row2),5 (row6). Sum is3+5+3+5=16. But output is8.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output's numbers are either the same as the input or replaced with 8, 5, etc. For example, in example0's output, the 5 remains. In example1's output, the 2 in row3, column5 remains. In example2's output, the5 in row6 remains. So maybe certain numbers are left unchanged, and others are replaced based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that when two consecutive non-zero elements are found in a row, they are replaced with their sum plus the number of such pairs. For example, in example0, one pair: sum5 +1=6. Not 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, when two non-zero elements are consecutive in a row, they are replaced by their sum multiplied by the number of non-zero elements in their columns. For example,3's column has1 non-zero,2's column has2. (1+2)=3.5*3=15. No.\n\nThis is taking too long. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nFrom the examples, the pattern seems to be that consecutive non-zero elements in a row are summed, and possibly added to some value (like their column sum) to get the result. In example0 and example1, the sum of the pair plus the column sum of the first element gives the output. In example0, 3+2=5, column0 sum3:5+3=8. In example1's row1,3+2=5, column2 sum3:5+3=8. In example2's row2,2+3=5, column2 sum2:5+2=7 (but output is8). So this doesn't fit. So perhaps in example2, column3 sum is3 (from row2) +5 (row6) =8. So 5+8=13. No. Output is8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in example2, the sum is2+3=5, and column3 sum is3 (row2) +5 (row6)=8. 5+8=13. Not matching. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the pair and the sum of the entire row. For example0's row sum is5. 5+5=10. Not8.\n\nHmm. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the pattern is that consecutive non-zero elements are summed and the result is replaced with their sum plus the number of non-zero elements in their respective columns. Or some other combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace consecutive non-zero elements in a row with the sum of the pair plus the number of non-zero elements in the first element's column. For example0's3 and2:5 +1 (column0 has1 non-zero) =6. No. Output is8.\n\nAnother possibility: consecutive non-zero elements are replaced with their sum plus the sum of their positions. For example0's3 at (0,0) and2 at (0,1). Sum is5. Positions (0+0) + (0+1) =1. 5+1=6. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the pair plus the product of their positions. 3+2 + (0*0 +0*1) =5. No.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should consider that the output numbers are all multiples of8. For example, 8,5 remains. But example1's row3's2 remains. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are replaced with the sum of all non-zero elements in their row and column. For example0's first cell:\n\nRow0 non-zero:3,2. Sum5.\n\nColumn0 non-zero:3. Sum3.\n\nTotal 5+3=8. Correct.\n\nExample1's row1, first element3:\n\nRow1 non-zero:3,2. Sum5.\n\nColumn2 non-zero:3. Sum3.\n\n5+3=8. Correct.\n\nExample1's row3, element3:\n\nRow3 non-zero:3,2. Sum5.\n\nColumn1 non-zero:3,2. Sum5.\n\n5+5=10. Output is8. Not matching.\n\nHmm. So this works for some cases but not others.\n\nMaybe the sum of the row's non-zero elements and the column's non-zero elements, but only if the element is the first in a consecutive pair.\n\nFor example0's3: row sum5, column sum3 \u21928.\n\nFor example1's row1,3: row sum5, column sum3 \u21928.\n\nFor example1's row3,3: row sum5, column sum5 \u219210. Output is8. No.\n\nThis is not working. Given the time I've spent and not finding the pattern, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples. It seems that consecutive non-zero elements in a row are summed and replaced with a number that's their sum plus the sum of their column. For example0 and example1, this works. For example2's row2, the consecutive pair (2,3) sum to5, and the column of2 (column2) has sum2. 5+2=7. But output is8. So this doesn't fit. Perhaps there's another factor. Maybe the column sum includes the element itself. In example0's column0 sum is3. In example1's column2 sum is3. In example2's column2 sum is2. So no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the column sum includes elements from other rows. For example2's row2, column3 has3 (row2) and5 (row6). Sum8. So 5 (pair sum) +8=13. Not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: the pair's sum is multiplied by the number of non-zero elements in their column. For example0's pair sum5. Column0 has1 element. 5*1=5. No. Output is8.\n\nI'm stuck. Given the time, perhaps I'll proceed with the pattern that consecutive non-zero elements are replaced by their sum plus the column sum of the first element, and apply that to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0]\n\nLooking for consecutive non-zero pairs:\n\nRow0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5] \u2192 has 2 and5 separated by zeros. Not consecutive.\n\nRow1: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0] \u2192 3 and2 are consecutive (positions6 and7).\n\nRow4: [5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 no consecutive pairs.\n\nRow6: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0] \u21925 and3 are consecutive (positions0 and1), and5 and2 (positions5 and7) are not consecutive.\n\nSo consecutive pairs are in row1 (3 and2) and row6 (5 and3).\n\nFor row1's pair3 and2:\n\nSum is5. Column for3 is column6. Let's compute column6's sum:\n\nLooking at test input's column6:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nSo column6 sum is3. So 5+3=8. Replace3 with8, set2 to0.\n\nFor row6's pair5 and3:\n\nSum is8. Column for5 is column0. Column0's sum:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:5\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:5\n\nSum is5+5=10. So 8+10=18. But output examples have8 as a common number. So this doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe the column sum is for the column of the first element (5 in column0). Sum is5 (row4) +5 (row6) =10. So 5+3=8 +10=18. Not matching examples. So perhaps this isn't the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is different. For each consecutive pair in a row, sum them and replace with8. So regardless of anything, replace consecutive pairs with8. But example0's pair3+2=5 becomes8. Example1's pair3+2=5 becomes8. Example2's pair2+3=5 becomes8. So maybe the rule is that any consecutive pair of non-zero numbers in a row are replaced by8, with the first element as8 and the second as0.\n\nIf that's the case, then in the test input:\n\nRow1's pair3 and2 would become8 and0. Row6's pair5 and3 would become8 and0. Then, in example2's row5, the3 and2 become8 and0, and the isolated3 becomes8. But why in example2's row5, the3 becomes8? Because there's another3 in the same column. Not sure.\n\nBut according to this hypothesis, any consecutive pair of non-zero would be replaced by8. Let's see:\n\nTest input row1's3 and2 would become8 and0. So row1 becomes [0,2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes isolated non-zero elements are replaced with8. Like example1's row3's3 becomes8. So this theory is incomplete.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach and see.\n\nThe test input has consecutive pairs in row1 and row6. Let's replace those pairs with8 and0.\n\nRow1 becomes: [0,2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow6 becomes: [8,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,0]\n\nBut looking at example2's row5, the isolated3 becomes8. So maybe any non-zero element that has a non-zero in the same column below is replaced with8. For example, in test input's row3, the5 and2 are in column4 and9. Let's check column4:5 (row3), 0 (row4). Sum is5. Column9:2 (row3), 5 (row0). Sum is7. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the isolated non-zero elements are left as is unless they are part of a consecutive pair. But in example1's row3, the3 is not consecutive but replaced with8. So this theory is invalid.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to apply the pattern where consecutive non-zero pairs are replaced by8, and their following element by0. For the test input, this would modify row1 and row6.\n\nBut according to example2's row5, there are two 8s: one from the pair3,2 and another from the isolated3. So perhaps there's more to it. Maybe any non-zero element in a column that had a pair processed is also replaced by8. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the limited time, I'll proceed with the consecutive pair replacement to8 and0, and see if other elements might be affected.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5] \u2192 no consecutive pairs. So remains.\n\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0] \u2192 3 and2 in positions6 and7. Replace with8 and0: becomes [0,2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no pairs. So remains.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2] \u2192 no consecutive pairs.\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no consecutive pairs.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 no pairs.\n\nRow6: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0] \u21925 and3 in positions0 and1. Replace with8 and0. Also,5 and2 are in positions5 and7 (not consecutive). So row6 becomes [8,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,0].\n\nBut according to the training examples, sometimes isolated numbers are replaced. For example, in example1's row3, the3 is replaced. So perhaps after processing pairs, we need to look for any non-zero elements in columns that were processed and replace them with8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another rule that if a column has a non-zero element that was part of a pair, then other elements in the same column are summed. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the consecutive pair replacement and see if the answer matches the training examples' pattern.\n\nBut according to example2's row5, the3 and2 are replaced with8, and the isolated3 is replaced with8. This suggests that even non-consecutive elements are replaced, possibly if they are in certain columns. But without knowing the exact rule, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAfter struggling, I think the correct pattern is that consecutive non-zero pairs in a row are replaced by8, and any non-zero elements that are in columns where there's a non-zero element below are also replaced by8. But this is just a guess.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the final answer would have the pairs in row1 and row6 replaced with8, and other elements might be replaced based on column conditions. But without knowing exactly, it's risky.\n\nGiven the time, I'll provide an answer based on replacing consecutive pairs with8 and0.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input matrices are transformed into the output matrices. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n[3, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nThe output is:\n[8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0]\n\nHmm, so the first row had 3 and 2, which became 8. 3+2=5, but 8 is higher. Wait, 3 and 2 multiply to 6? No. Maybe 3+2+ something else? Or maybe there's a shift. Wait, looking at the output, the 3 and 2 in the first row are replaced by 8, and the rest are zeros except the 5 in the third row. So 3 and 2 are adjacent? In the input's first row, they are adjacent. Maybe their sum is replaced by 8? 3+2=5, but 8 is 3+2+3? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe they are being summed and then the next number is added? Wait, 3+2+5=10, but that's not 8. Maybe it's a different approach.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has in row 1: [0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0], which in the output becomes [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]. So again, 3 and 2 adjacent are replaced by 8, and the 2 is gone. Similarly, in the fourth row of input, [0,3,0,0,0,2], the output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So here, the 3 is replaced by 8, but the 2 remains. Wait, that's different. Wait, in that fourth row, the 3 and 2 are not adjacent. The 3 is in position 2, and the 2 is in position 6. So maybe it's not just adjacent numbers. Wait, but in the first example, the 3 and 2 were adjacent. In Example1's first change, the 3 and 2 were adjacent and replaced by 8. Then in the fourth row, the 3 is replaced by 8 and the 2 stays. So maybe the 3 is being replaced by 8 when there's a 2 in the same row but not adjacent. Or perhaps it's a diagonal? Or maybe it's about pairs of numbers in the same row where their sum is 5, then replaced by 8? 3+2=5, and 5+3=8? Hmm, not sure. Let me check Example 2.\n\nIn Example2's input, the third row is [5,0,2,3,0,0,0], which in the output becomes [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So 2 and 3 adjacent are replaced by 8. So that's again 2+3=5, and replaced by 8. Similarly, in the sixth row of input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0], which in output becomes [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So here, 3 and 2 in the first two positions become 8, and the 3 at the end becomes 8. Wait, that's different. So maybe when there are consecutive 3 and 2, they are replaced by 8. But in the sixth row, the input is 3,2, then later 3. The output has 8 in the first position and 8 in the sixth. So how does that work?\n\nWait, let's see. The input row is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the 3 and 2 at the start are replaced by 8. Then the 3 at position 5 (0-based index 5?) is replaced by 8. So maybe any 3 or 2 in the row is replaced by 8, but only if they are in a certain condition. Alternatively, perhaps whenever a 3 and a 2 are present in the same row, regardless of their positions, they are summed or converted into 8s. But in Example1's fourth row, there's a 3 and a 2, and the 3 becomes 8 but the 2 remains. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at Example1's fourth row input: [0,3,0,0,0,2]. Output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So here, the 3 becomes 8, but the 2 stays. Why? Maybe because the 3 is followed by a 2 in the same row but separated by zeros. Or maybe only the first occurrence of 3 in a row where there's also a 2 gets replaced by 8. Or perhaps it's the sum of all 3s and 2s in the row, but that doesn't fit because in Example0's first row, sum is 5 (3+2), which is replaced by 8. 5 + 3 is 8? Not sure. Or maybe 3 and 2 are being multiplied (3*2=6) plus 2 gives 8? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 and 2 are being replaced by their sum plus 3? 3+2=5, 5+3=8. But why add 3? Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output: the first row has 8, and the third row's 5 remains. So maybe 3 and 2 in the same row sum to 5, and then 5 is replaced by 8? But in Example1's first changed row, the sum of 3+2=5 becomes 8, but in the fourth row, the 3 is replaced by 8 even though the 2 is present. Maybe the 3 and 2 in the same row, regardless of position, are each converted to 8, but only once. Wait, in Example1's first changed row, the 3 and 2 are replaced by 8. So the 3 and 2 become 8 and 0. But in the fourth row of Example1, the 3 becomes 8 and the 2 remains. That's inconsistent. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each row, the sum of all 3s and 2s is converted into 8s, with the positions of the 3s and 2s being replaced by 8s and the rest zeros. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's first row: [3,2,0] sum is 5. But output is [8,0,0]. So 8 is there. So maybe 3+2=5, but 8 is 5 +3? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 3 and 2 are replaced by 8 regardless, but perhaps the sum of all 3s and 2s in the row is replaced by 8. But in Example0's first row, sum is 5, but output is 8. So perhaps the sum is multiplied by some number. 5 * 1.6 =8? But that's not a clean operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps whenever a 3 and a 2 are present in the same row, each 3 is replaced by 8 and each 2 is replaced by 0, but only if there's at least one 2 in the row. Let's check Example0's first row: 3 and 2. So 3 becomes 8, 2 becomes 0. So output [8,0,0]. That fits. Example1's first row in output: [0,0,8,0,0,0], which would be replacing the 3 and 2 (both in positions 2 and 3) with 8 and 0. Wait, but in Example1's input row [0,0,3,2,0,0], the output becomes [0,0,8,0,0,0], so yes, replacing 3 with 8 and 2 with 0. Then in the fourth row of Example1's input: [0,3,0,0,0,2]. The 3 is replaced by 8, and the 2 is replaced by 0. But the output shows the 2 remains as 2. Wait, that's conflicting. In the output, it's [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 3 became 8, but the 2 stayed as 2. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nHmm. Let me re-examine Example1's fourth row input and output. Input is [0,3,0,0,0,2]. Output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 3 becomes 8, but the 2 remains. That's odd. So the rule can't be that all 2s in a row with a 3 are replaced by 0. So maybe the rule is that in each row, if there's at least one 3 and at least one 2, then all 3s become 8 and 2s remain. But in Example0, the 2 was replaced by 0. Wait, no. Example0's first row input has 3 and 2, output has 8 and 0. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that when a 3 is immediately followed by a 2 in the same row, they are replaced by 8 and 0. In Example0's first row, 3 is followed by 2, so they become 8 and 0. In Example1's first row, 3 is followed by 2, so they become 8 and 0. In Example1's fourth row, the 3 is at position 2 (assuming 0-based) and the 2 is at position 5. Not adjacent. So the 3 becomes 8, but the 2 remains. Then in Example2's third row input [5,0,2,3,0,0,0], the 2 is followed by 3, so they become 0 and 8? The output here is [5,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So the 2 and 3 (adjacent) are replaced by 0 and 8. Wait, that's different from the first example where 3 followed by 2 became 8 and 0. So maybe the order matters. If it's 3 followed by 2, they become 8 and 0. If it's 2 followed by 3, they become 0 and 8. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's first row, 3 followed by 2 \u2192 8 and 0. That's the case. In Example2's third row, 2 followed by 3 \u2192 0 and 8. So that fits. Then in Example2's sixth row input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The first two elements are 3 followed by 2, which would become 8 and 0. The last 3 is followed by nothing. But in the output, the first becomes 8, and the sixth element (which was 3) becomes 8. Wait, that's confusing. The input's sixth row: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. Output is [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the first 3 and 2 are replaced by 8 and 0, and the last 3 is replaced by 8. Why?\n\nHmm. So maybe any 3 in a row that has at least one 2 is replaced by 8, regardless of position. And the 2s are replaced by 0 if they are adjacent to a 3. But in Example1's fourth row, the 2 is at the end and the 3 is in the middle, so the 2 is not adjacent, so it remains. So in that case, the 3 becomes 8, and the 2 stays. Then in Example2's sixth row, the first 3 is adjacent to a 2, so replaced by 8, and the 2 becomes 0. The last 3 in that row is not adjacent to any 2 (since the row is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]), the last 3 is at index 5. Are there any 2s in that row? Yes, the second element is 2. So if any 3 in a row with at least one 2 becomes 8, then all 3s in that row become 8. But then why in Example1's fourth row, the 2 remains?\n\nWait, Example1's fourth row input is [0,3,0,0,0,2]. So there's a 3 and a 2. So if the rule is that any 3 in a row with at least one 2 becomes 8, then the 3 would become 8. The 2 would be converted to 0 if there's a 3 in the same row. But in the output, the 2 remains. So that contradicts that idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that whenever a 3 is followed by a 2 (in consecutive positions), they are replaced by 8 and 0. And whenever a 2 is followed by a 3, they are replaced by 0 and 8. But for 3s and 2s that are not adjacent but in the same row, they are replaced individually. But then how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe all 3s in the row are replaced by 8 if there's at least one 2 in the row. And all 2s are replaced by 0 if there's at least one 3 in the row. Let's check.\n\nExample0's first row has both 3 and 2. So replace all 3s with 8 and all 2s with 0. That gives [8,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's first changed row: input [0,0,3,2,0,0]. Both 3 and 2 present. Replace 3 with 8 and 2 with 0 \u2192 [0,0,8,0,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's fourth row input [0,3,0,0,0,2]. Replace 3 with 8 and 2 with 0 \u2192 [0,8,0,0,0,0]. But the output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So that's a contradiction. The 2 remains as 2 in the output. So this rule can't be right.\n\nHmm. So maybe the 2 is only replaced if it's adjacent to a 3. Let's see. In Example1's fourth row, the 2 is at the end, not adjacent to the 3. So the 3 is replaced by 8, and the 2 remains. But in Example0's first row, the 2 is adjacent to the 3, so it's replaced by 0. So perhaps the rule is:\n\nIn each row, for every occurrence of a 3 adjacent to a 2 (either left or right), replace the 3 with 8 and the 2 with 0. But for non-adjacent 3s and 2s in the same row, they are left as is. Wait, but in Example2's sixth row, the input is [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The first 3 is adjacent to 2, so replaced by 8 and the 2 becomes 0. The third 3 is not adjacent to any 2, so it's replaced by 8? But how does that fit? Because in the output, both 3s are replaced by 8. So maybe if a row has any 3 and 2 adjacent pairs, then all 3s in the row are replaced by 8, regardless of their position. But then, in Example1's fourth row, there's a 3 and a 2 not adjacent. The 3 is replaced by 8, but the 2 stays. So perhaps when a row has any 3 and 2 (regardless of adjacency), all 3s become 8, and all 2s become 0. But that conflicts with Example1's fourth row output where the 2 remains.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: For each 3 in the row, if there exists a 2 somewhere in the row, replace the 3 with 8. For each 2 in the row, if there exists a 3 somewhere in the row, replace the 2 with 0. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's first row: [3,2,0]. Both 3 and 2 present. So 3 \u21928, 2\u21920. Output [8,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's first row: [0,0,3,2,0,0]. 3 and 2 present. So 3\u21928, 2\u21920. Output [0,0,8,0,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's fourth row: [0,3,0,0,0,2]. 3 and 2 present. So 3\u21928, 2\u21920. Output should be [0,8,0,0,0,0]. But the actual output is [0,8,0,0,0,2]. So this contradicts. So the rule isn't correct.\n\nHmm. So there's a problem here. Maybe the 2 is only replaced if it's in the same row as a 3 and is adjacent to it. Otherwise, the 2 stays. Let's try that.\n\nExample0's first row: 3 and 2 adjacent. 3\u21928, 2\u21920. Correct.\n\nExample1's first row: 3 and 2 adjacent. 3\u21928, 2\u21920. Correct.\n\nExample1's fourth row: 3 and 2 are not adjacent. 3\u21928 (since there's a 2 in the row), but 2 stays. Output matches.\n\nExample2's sixth row input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The first 3 and 2 are adjacent. So 3\u21928, 2\u21920. The third 3 is in a row with a 2 (the 2 was in position 1). So this 3 would be replaced by 8. So output would be [8,0,0,0,0,8,0], which matches the example.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each row, if there's at least one pair of adjacent 3 and 2 (in any order), then replace all 3s in the row with 8 and all 2s with 0. Otherwise, replace any 3 in the row with 8 if there's a 2 in the row (even if not adjacent), but leave the 2 as is. Wait, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe whenever a row contains both 3 and 2, all 3s are replaced by 8, and any 2 that is adjacent to a 3 is replaced by 0. So 2s not adjacent to 3s remain.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0's first row: 3 and 2 adjacent. So 3\u21928, adjacent 2\u21920. Output [8,0,0]. Correct.\n\nExample1's first row: 3 and 2 adjacent. So 3\u21928, adjacent 2\u21920. Output correct.\n\nExample1's fourth row: 3 and 2 are present but not adjacent. So 3\u21928. The 2 is not adjacent to any 3, so it remains. Output [0,8,0,0,0,2]. Correct.\n\nExample2's sixth row: the first 3 is adjacent to 2, so 3\u21928, 2\u21920. The other 3 is in the same row as a 2 (the one that was turned to 0?), but it's not adjacent. So since the row has at least one 2 (even if turned to 0?), all 3s become 8. So the last 3 becomes 8. Output [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. Correct.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each row:\n\n1. If there are both 3 and 2 in the row:\n\n   a. Replace all 3s with 8.\n\n   b. Replace any 2 that is adjacent to a 3 (original position, before replacement) with 0.\n\n   c. Leave other 2s (not adjacent to any 3) as they are.\n\nWait, but how do you determine adjacency before replacement? Because the adjacency is checked in the original input.\n\nIn Example1's fourth row: [0,3,0,0,0,2]. The 3 is at index 1, and the 2 is at index 5. They are not adjacent. So in this case, the 3 is replaced by 8 (since there's a 2 in the row), but the 2 is not adjacent to any 3, so it stays. So output [0,8,0,0,0,2]. Correct.\n\nIn Example2's sixth row input: [3,2,0,0,0,3,0]. The original adjacency: the 3 at 0 is adjacent to 2 at 1. So 3\u21928, 2\u21920. The 3 at index 5 is not adjacent to any 2 (original 2 was at index 1). So since there's a 2 in the row (even though it's now 0?), all 3s become 8. Wait, but the 3 at index5 is in a row that has at least one 2 (originally). So according to the rule, all 3s are replaced by 8. So the output becomes [8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- For each row:\n\n   - Check if there are both 3 and 2 in the row.\n\n   - If yes:\n\n      - Replace all 3s with 8.\n\n      - For each 2 in the row, if it was adjacent to any 3 in the original row, replace it with 0.\n\nSo in Example1's fourth row, the 2 is not adjacent to any 3, so it stays.\n\nIn Example2's sixth row, the first 2 is adjacent to a 3, so replaced by 0. The other 3 is not adjacent to any 2, but since the row contains a 2, it's replaced by 8.\n\nSo this seems to fit all examples.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5] \u2192 has a 2 but no 3. So no changes. Output same as input.\n\nRow 1: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0] \u2192 has 2s and a 3. Check if there's both 3 and 2. Yes.\n\nReplace all 3s with 8. The 3 is at position 6. Then check which 2s are adjacent to 3 in original row.\n\nOriginal row has 2 at positions 1 and 7. The 3 is at position6. So the 3 is adjacent to position5 (0) and 7 (2). So the 2 at position7 is adjacent to the 3. So replace that 2 with 0. The 2 at position1 is not adjacent to any 3, so remains.\n\nSo row1 becomes [0,2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 has a 3 but no 2. So no changes.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2] \u2192 has a 2 but no 3. No changes.\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 has a 2 but no 3. No changes.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 has a 3 but no 2. No changes.\n\nRow6: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0] \u2192 has a 3 and 2. Replace all 3s with 8. Check adjacency of 2 to 3.\n\nOriginal row: 3 is at position1, 2 at position7. Are they adjacent? Position1 and7 are separated by several columns. So no adjacency. So 3 becomes 8, and 2 remains. So row6 becomes [5,8,0,0,0,5,0,2,0].\n\nBut wait, the row also has a 2. So according to the rule, replace all 3s with 8, and any 2 adjacent to a 3 (original positions) becomes 0. Since the 2 is not adjacent to the 3, it stays. So row6's output is [5,8,0,0,0,5,0,2,0].\n\nSo compiling all the rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5] \u2192 no change.\n\nRow1: [0,2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no 2s, so remains [0,3,...] \u2192 wait, no. Wait, row2 has a 3 but no 2. So according to the rule, if there's no 2 in the row, the 3 remains. So row2 stays as is. But according to the pattern, if a row has a 3 and a 2, then replace 3s with 8. But in row2, there's no 2, so the 3 remains. So output row2 remains [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, when a row has a 3 but no 2, it's left as is. So yes.\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0]\n\nWait, but in the test input row1, the original 3 is at position6 (0-based index6?), and the 2 is at position7. Are they adjacent? Let's confirm the indices. Let's count positions starting from 0.\n\nRow1 input: [0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0]\n\nPositions:\n\n0:0\n\n1:2\n\n2:0\n\n3:0\n\n4:0\n\n5:0\n\n6:3\n\n7:2\n\n8:0\n\nSo the 3 is at position6, the 2 at position7. These are adjacent. So according to the rule, in row1, the 3 is replaced by8 and the adjacent 2 (position7) is replaced by0. So row1 becomes:\n\nOriginal row1: [0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0]\n\nAfter processing:\n\nReplace all 3s with8 \u2192 position6 becomes8.\n\nCheck which 2s are adjacent to any 3. The 3 was at position6. The 2s are at positions1 and7. The 2 at position7 is adjacent to the 3 (position6 and7 are adjacent). So replace that 2 with0. The 2 at position1 is not adjacent to any 3, so remains.\n\nSo row1's output becomes [0,2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nYes.\n\nRow6 input: [5,3,0,0,0,5,0,2,0]\n\n3 is at position1, 2 at position7. These are not adjacent (positions1 and7 are separated by 5 positions). So in row6, replace 3 with8, but the 2 is not adjacent, so remains. So output row6 becomes [5,8,0,0,0,5,0,2,0].\n\nSo the final output is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0]\n\nBut wait, looking back at the training examples, in Example0's third row has 5 and it's left as is. So the non-3 and 2 numbers remain. So the answer should follow that.",
