        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, especially Example 0 and Example 1, the input arrays are being transformed into output arrays where some of the 0s and other numbers are replaced with a sequence of numbers like 3,2,3,2,3 or 1,4,1,4, etc. \n\nFirst, I'll look at Example 0. The input has a lot of 8s, 0s, and a few 3s and 2s. The output seems to replace some 0s with a sequence that alternates between 3 and 2. For instance, in the first input row of Example 0, the zeros between the 8s become 3,2,3,2,3. Similarly, in Example 1, the zeros are replaced with alternating 1 and 4. So maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a sequence of zeros between certain numbers (like 8s or other numbers), they are replaced with an alternating sequence starting with a higher number (like 3 or 1) and then alternates with a lower number (like 2 or 4). \n\nWait, looking closer at Example 0's output, the first row starts with 8, then 3,2,3,2,3, and then continues with 8s. The original input was [8,0,0,0,0,0,8...]. So five zeros become 3,2,3,2,3. That's five elements, but the output sequence is 3,2,3,2,3 (5 elements). Similarly, in the second row of Example 0's input: [0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8...] becomes [3,2,8,8,8,2,3,2,3,2,3,8...]. The two initial zeros become 3,2, then the next five zeros (after the 8s) become 2,3,2,3,2,3. Wait, the input has six zeros there. Let me count: after the 8, the input is 0,0,0,0,0,0 (six zeros), which in the output become 2,3,2,3,2,3. So perhaps the pattern alternates starting with 2 or 3 depending on the position.\n\nWait, maybe the direction matters. For sequences of zeros that are between non-zero numbers, the replacement alternates between two values, starting with the higher one first. For example, in Example 0, when a zero sequence is between 8s, the replacement starts with 3, then 2, 3, etc. In Example 1, when zeros are between 8 and 0s, maybe the starting number is different. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the first row's input ends with a bunch of zeros which become 1,4,1,4,1. The input had [0,0,0,0,0,8] and the output becomes [1,4,1,4,1,8]. So five zeros replaced by 1,4,1,4,1. So again, the alternation is between 1 and 4 here. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the replacement numbers (like 3 and 2, or 1 and 4) might depend on the numbers surrounding the zero sequence. For instance, in Example 0, the 3 and 2 are used, which are adjacent to 8s. In Example 1, the 1 and 4 are used, and in the test input, there's a 4 and 3 present. Hmm. Maybe the numbers used in the alternation are the numbers that are adjacent to the zero sequences. \n\nWait, in Example 0's first input row: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8...], the zeros are between 8 and 8. The replacement is 3,2,3,2,3. But where do 3 and 2 come from? Maybe they are derived from the surrounding numbers. Wait, 8 is a high number. But how 3 and 2 relate to 8? Maybe not directly. Alternatively, maybe the numbers used in the alternation are the ones that appear in the input. For example, in Example 0's input, there are 3 and 2 in some rows. Like in the seventh row of input 0, there's a 3 and a 2. Similarly, in Example 1's input, there are 1 and 4. So maybe the rule is that whenever there's a sequence of zeros, they are replaced by an alternating sequence of the two smallest distinct numbers present in the input array. Wait, in Example 0's input, the numbers are 8,0,3,2. So the two smallest non-zero numbers are 2 and 3. So the alternation is 3 and 2. In Example 1's input, the numbers are 0,8,1,4. The two smallest are 1 and 4. So alternation is 1 and 4. \n\nLooking at the test input, the numbers present are 8,0,4,3. So the two smallest non-zero are 3 and 4? Wait, but 3 is smaller than 4. So perhaps the alternation is between 3 and 4, starting with 3. But in the test input, let's check the output.\n\nWait, the test input's third row is [0,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8...]. The output for this row would have to replace any zero sequences. But according to the pattern, if the two smallest non-zero numbers are 3 and 4, then alternation would be between those. But let's check the test input. Let's see: in the test input, the numbers are 8,0,4,3. So 3 and 4 are the two smallest non-zero. So the alternation should be 3 and 4, starting with 3. \n\nBut wait in the first example's test input, the zeros are replaced by 1 and 4. The input has 1 and 4 as the two smallest. So the pattern is to alternate between the two smallest non-zero numbers in the entire input array, starting with the smaller one. Wait, in example 0, the two smallest non-zero numbers are 2 and 3, so the alternation starts with 3? Or maybe the order is determined by the positions of the numbers in the input. Hmm, maybe I need to look again.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the numbers are 8,0,3,2. So non-zero are 8,3,2. The two smallest are 2 and 3. So perhaps the alternation starts with the higher of the two (3) and alternates with the lower (2). Because in the output, the sequence is 3,2,3,2,3 for a 5-length zero run. Similarly, in Example 1's input, the non-zero numbers include 8,1,4. The two smallest are 1 and 4. So the alternation starts with 1 and then 4. For example, in the first row of output in Example 1, the zeros become 1,4,1,4,1. So that's starting with 1, then 4, etc. So the order is smallest first, then next. So the pattern is: for a run of zeros, replace them with an alternating sequence of the two smallest non-zero numbers in the input, starting with the smaller one and alternating. \n\nIn the test input, the non-zero numbers are 8,4,3. The two smallest are 3 and 4. So the alternation should start with 3, then 4, then 3, etc. Let's check the test input's rows to see where zeros are.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nFirst row: [8,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The zeros here are in positions 2,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. But the output would need to replace consecutive zeros between non-zero numbers. Let's break this into runs. \n\nBetween the 8s: The first run is a single 0 at position 2 (between 8,8 and 8). Then after the 8 at position 6, there's a 0 followed by several zeros. But perhaps the zeros are grouped into runs between non-zero numbers. For example, the first 0 at position 2 is between 8 and 8. Then the zeros after position 6 (the 8) are a long run. But let's see:\n\nThe input row is:\n\n8,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nBreaking into runs of zeros:\n\n- After the 8 at index 1 (value 8), there's a 0 at index 2, then 8 at 3. So that's a single 0. Then between 8 at 3 and 8 at 6 (position 6?), the zeros are at 4 and 5. Then after the 8 at position 6, there's a long run of zeros from position 7 to 14. \n\nBut how are these runs replaced? In the training examples, the replacement is done for each run of zeros. So in Example 0's first input row, the run of 5 zeros is replaced by 3,2,3,2,3. Similarly, a run of 6 zeros in the second row of Example 0 becomes 2,3,2,3,2,3. So the alternation starts with the first number (3 in that case) and alternates each position.\n\nWait, perhaps the starting number depends on the position of the zero run. Like, if the zero run is in an even position or something. Alternatively, maybe the alternation starts with the first number (smallest) and alternates. But in Example 0, the two smallest non-zero numbers are 2 and 3. But the alternation starts with 3, then 2. So that contradicts the idea of starting with the smaller. So maybe the order is determined by the order in which the numbers appear in the input? For instance, in Example 0, the numbers 3 and 2 appear in the input. Which comes first? In the first example's input, the 3 and 2 are in the seventh row: [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]. Here, the 3 comes before the 2. So maybe the order is determined by the first occurrence of the numbers. In Example 0, 3 occurs before 2. So the alternation starts with 3, then 2. \n\nIn Example 1, the input includes 1 and 4. The first occurrence of 1 is in the eighth row at position 4: [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]. Then the first occurrence of 4 is in the ninth row at position 4: [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]. So 1 comes before 4. Therefore, the alternation starts with 1, then 4. Which matches the output in Example 1, where the zeros are replaced by 1,4,1,4, etc. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each run of zeros in the input, replace them with an alternating sequence starting with the first encountered non-zero number (smallest is not necessarily the case, but the first occurrence in the entire input of the two smallest non-zero numbers? Wait, perhaps the two distinct non-zero numbers that are present in the input, and the order is determined by their first occurrence in the input. So in the test input, the non-zero numbers are 8,4,3. Let's check the order of first occurrence. The test input's first row is [8,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,...]. The first non-zero is 8. Then in the second row, there's a 4 at position 7. Third row has a 4 and 3. So first occurrence of 3 is in the third row. The order of first occurrence for the non-zero numbers is 8 (appears first), then 4 (appears second in row 2), then 3 (appears in row 3). So the two smallest non-zero numbers are 3 and 4. Since 3 appears after 4 in the input, the order of alternation would be 4 first then 3? Or wait, maybe the first two distinct non-zero numbers. Wait, in Example 0, the non-zero numbers are 8,3,2. The first two distinct non-zero numbers (other than 8) are 3 and 2. But in the input, 3 appears first in the seventh row. Wait, the input for Example 0 has 3 and 2 in the seventh and eighth rows. So 3 comes first. So the alternation is 3 and 2. \n\nIn the test input, the two distinct non-zero numbers (other than 8) are 4 and 3. The first occurrence of 4 is in the second row, position 7. The first occurrence of 3 is in the third row, position 6. So 4 comes before 3 in the input. Therefore, the alternation would be between 4 and 3, starting with 4. So for a run of zeros, replace them with 4,3,4,3,... etc. \n\nWait, but in the test input's third row: [0,8,0,0,0,0,4,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]. The zeros in positions 2,3,4,5. So the run is four zeros. So replacing them with 4,3,4,3. Let's see what the output would be. \n\nWait, but perhaps the direction or the surrounding numbers affect the starting number. For example, if a zero run is between two 8s, maybe the starting number is the first of the two alternation numbers, but if it's next to a different number, it might start with the other. Or perhaps it's always the first occurrence order. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the alternation starts with the higher number. In Example 0, the two numbers are 3 and 2. Higher is 3. So alternation starts with 3. In Example 1, the numbers are 1 and 4. Higher is 4, but alternation starts with 1. So that doesn't fit. So that idea is out. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is determined by the first occurrence of the numbers. In Example 0, 3 appears before 2. So alternation is 3,2. In Example 1, 1 appears before 4. So alternation is 1,4. In the test input, 4 appears before 3. So alternation would be 4,3. \n\nSo for the test input, any run of zeros would be replaced by 4,3,4,3, etc. Let's check the test input's first row: [8,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The first zero is between two 8s. So that single zero would become 4. Then the next two zeros (positions 4 and 5) between 8 and 8: replaced by 4,3. Then after the 8 at position 6, there's a run of 8 zeros. So they would be replaced starting with 4, then 3, etc. So the first run (length 1): 4. The next run (length 2): 4,3. The next run (length 8): 4,3,4,3,4,3,4,3. \n\nSo the first row output would be: 8,8,4,8,4,3,8,4,3,4,3,4,3,4,3. \n\nBut let's look at the other examples. For instance, in Example 0, a run of 5 zeros becomes 3,2,3,2,3. The starting number is 3 (the first of the two), then alternates. So the first element is the first number in the pair, then alternates. \n\nSo applying this to the test input, the first row's zero runs would be:\n\n- After 8,8: a single 0 \u2192 4.\n\n- Then between 8 and 8: two zeros \u2192 4,3.\n\n- Then after the next 8, a long run of 8 zeros \u2192 4,3,4,3,4,3,4,3.\n\nSo the first row's output would be: [8,8,4,8,4,3,8,4,3,4,3,4,3,4,3]. \n\nSimilarly, in the third row of the test input: [0,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,0,8,8,8]. The zeros are at position 0, and position 11. The zero at position 0 is before any other numbers, so perhaps it's part of a run. But the row starts with 0,8,... So that's a single zero, replaced by 4. Then the zero at position 11 is between 8 and 8. So that's a single zero, replaced by 4. \n\nAnother example: the second row of the test input is [0,8,0,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The zeros are at position 0 and 2. Position 0 is leading zeros, perhaps between nothing and 8. So replaced by 4. Position 2 is a single zero between 8 and 8. Replaced by 4. \n\nWait, but in Example 0's first row, leading zeros (if any) might be replaced. But looking at Example 1's first input row, which starts with [0,0,0,8...], the output starts with [0,0,0,8...]. Wait no, in Example 1's output, the first row is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,1,4,1,4,1,8]. So the first three zeros are left as zeros. Only the zeros after the 8 are replaced. Hmm. So maybe the replacement happens only for zeros that are between non-zero elements. Or perhaps leading and trailing zeros are not replaced. \n\nWait in Example 0's first input row, the first element is 8, then zeros. The zeros are between 8 and 8. So they are replaced. The output starts with 8,3,2,3,2,3,8... So the leading zero (if any) is replaced. But in Example 1's first row, the input starts with [0,0,0,8...], which in the output remains [0,0,0,8...]. So leading zeros are not replaced. So the rule must be that only runs of zeros that are between non-zero elements are replaced. So leading or trailing zeros (not enclosed by non-zero on both sides) are left as 0. \n\nSo for the test input's third row: [0,8,0,0,0,0,4,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]. The first 0 is at position 0. Since it's leading, before an 8, but there's nothing before it. So it's not between two non-zero elements, so it's not replaced. The zeros from position 2 to 5 are between 8 (position 1) and 4 (position 6). So that's a run of 4 zeros. So replaced by 4,3,4,3. Then the zeros from position 9 to 13 are between 8 (position 8) and 8 (position 14). So a run of 5 zeros. Replaced by 4,3,4,3,4. \n\nSo the third row's output would be: [0,8,4,3,4,3,4,3,8,4,3,4,3,4,8]. \n\nBut let's verify this with the training examples. \n\nIn Example 0's second row input: [0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8...]. The output is [3,2,8,8,8,2,3,2,3,2,3,8...]. The leading zeros (before the first 8) are replaced. Wait, in the input, the first two zeros are leading, then 8. But in the output, they become 3,2. So according to that, leading zeros are replaced. But in Example 1's first row, leading zeros are left as zeros. Hmm, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe the replacement occurs for any run of zeros, regardless of their position, as long as they are between non-zero elements. But leading zeros (before the first non-zero) or trailing (after the last non-zero) are left as is. \n\nIn Example 0's second row input: the first two zeros are leading, then comes 8. So they are leading zeros. But in the output, they are replaced with 3,2. So that contradicts the idea that leading zeros are not replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe any run of zeros, regardless of their position, are replaced. But in Example 1's first row, the leading zeros are not replaced. Wait, in Example 1's first input row: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]. The output is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,1,4,1,4,1,8]. So the first three zeros (leading) are left as 0, but the zeros between the 8s are replaced. So that suggests that only zeros that are between non-zero elements are replaced. The leading zeros and trailing zeros (after the last non-zero) are left as 0. \n\nIn Example 0's second row input: [0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8...]. The zeros before the first 8 are leading, but in the output they are replaced. Wait, the input's second row starts with [0,0,8...], and the output is [3,2,8...]. So leading zeros are being replaced here. This contradicts the previous example. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. So maybe the rule is that any run of zeros is replaced, regardless of their position. But in Example 1's first row, the leading zeros are left as zeros, but in Example 0's second row, leading zeros are replaced. So there's inconsistency. \n\nWait, looking back at Example 0's second row input and output:\n\nINPUT: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]\n\nOUTPUT: [3, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 8, 0, 0, 8, 2, 8, 0]\n\nSo the first two zeros (positions 0 and 1) are replaced with 3,2. But after the 8 at position 11, there's a zero, followed by three zeros (positions 12-14), which are left as 0s. So that's a run of zeros after the 8 but before the next 8 (position 15). So why are those zeros not replaced? \n\nWait, in the input row, the structure is: after the 8 at position 11 (value 8), there's a zero at position 12, then three zeros (positions 12-14?), then an 8 at position 15. So the zeros from 12 to 14 are between 8 and 8 (position 15). So they should be replaced. But in the output, those zeros are left as 0. So that's a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is only done for runs of zeros that are between two non-zero numbers. So in Example 0's second row, the leading zeros are between the start (nothing) and 8, so they are replaced. The zeros between 8 and 8 are replaced, but the zeros after the last 8 (position 23) are trailing and not replaced. \n\nBut in Example 1's first row, the leading zeros are not replaced. So there's inconsistency. Maybe the pattern is more complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement depends on the presence of certain numbers adjacent to the zero run. For example, in Example 0's second row, the leading zeros are replaced because the next number is 8. In Example 1's first row, the leading zeros are followed by 8, but they are not replaced. So that can't be it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement happens only when the run of zeros is surrounded by the same number. Like, if the zero run is between two 8s, then replaced. But in Example 0's second row, the leading zeros are before the first 8. So they are between nothing and 8. So maybe they are replaced. But in Example 1's first row, the leading zeros are before an 8 but not replaced. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another angle. Let's look at the numbers that are inserted in the output. In Example 0, the inserted numbers are 3 and 2, which are present in the input. In Example 1, the inserted numbers are 1 and 4, which are present. So the inserted numbers are always two distinct non-zero numbers from the input. \n\nIn the test input, the non-zero numbers are 8,4,3. So the inserted numbers should be 4 and 3. The first occurrence of 4 is in the second row, position 7. The first occurrence of 3 is in the third row, position 6. So the order is 4 first, then 3. So the alternation would be 4,3,4,3,...\n\nThus, in any run of zeros in the test input, they are replaced by alternating 4 and 3, starting with 4. \n\nNow, applying this to the test input's rows:\n\nTake the first test input row: [8,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBreaking into runs of zeros:\n\n- After the first two 8s: a single 0. This is between two 8s. Replaced with 4.\n\n- Between the 8 at position 3 and 8 at position 6: two zeros. Replaced with 4,3.\n\n- Between the 8 at position 6 and the end: eight zeros. This run is between 8 and nothing (since the row ends with zeros), so perhaps the trailing zeros are not replaced. Wait, but according to Example 0's second row, leading zeros are replaced. So maybe any run of zeros that is adjacent to at least one non-zero is replaced. So in this case, after the 8 at position 6, the zeros are between 8 and nothing. So maybe only the first zero is part of the run that is after a non-zero, so replace them all? Or maybe trailing zeros are not replaced. \n\nBut in Example 0's second row, the zeros after the last 8 are left as zeros. So perhaps trailing zeros are not replaced. Thus, in the first row of the test input, the zeros after the 8 at position 6 (positions 7-14) are trailing, so not replaced. Wait, but the row ends with zeros, so they are trailing. So in that case, they would remain zeros. But according to Example 0's second row, the zeros between two 8s are replaced, but trailing zeros after the last 8 are left as zeros. \n\nSo in the first test input row:\n\nAfter the 8 at position 6 (value 8), there are zeros from position 7 to 14. Since there's no non-zero after that, they are trailing and not replaced. So they remain zeros. \n\nWait, but in the first test input row, after the 8 at position 6, there's a 0 at position 7, then more zeros. So the zeros from position 7 to 14 are after the 8 and before the end of the array. So those are trailing zeros. Thus, they are not replaced. Only the zeros that are between two non-zero numbers are replaced. \n\nSo for the first test input row:\n\n- Between 8 and 8: single zero at position 2 \u2192 replaced with 4.\n\n- Between 8 (position 3) and 8 (position 6): zeros at 4 and 5 \u2192 replaced with 4,3.\n\n- Between 8 (position 6) and the end: zeros from 7 to 14 \u2192 not replaced.\n\nSo the first row's output would be: [8,8,4,8,4,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut wait, according to Example 0's first row, the trailing zeros after the last 8 were replaced. Wait, Example 0's first row input ends with 0,8,8,8,0. The output ends with 0,8,8,8,0. So the trailing zero after the last 8 remains. So maybe trailing zeros are not replaced. \n\nThus, the first row of test input's output would be:\n\n[8,8,4,8,4,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut in the training examples, sometimes trailing zeros are replaced. For example, in Example 0's fourth row input:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n\nThe output ends with 8, 0. The last zero is trailing and remains.\n\nAnother example: the eighth row of Example 0's input ends with 8,0. The output ends with 8,0. So trailing zeros are not replaced. \n\nThus, in the test input's first row, the zeros after the 8 at position 6 are trailing and remain zeros. \n\nNow, let's check the fifth row of the test input: [8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8]. The zeros are at positions 5,9,11,13. \n\nThe zero at position 5 is between 8 (position 4) and 8 (position 6). So replaced with 4.\n\nThe zero at position 9 is between 8 (position 8) and 8 (position 10). Replaced with 4.\n\nThe zero at position 11 is between 8 (position 10) and 8 (position 12). Replaced with 4.\n\nThe zero at position 13 is between 8 (position 12) and 8 (position 14). Replaced with 4. \n\nBut wait, all these zeros are single zeros. So each is replaced with 4. So the output row would be [8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,4,8]. \n\nBut wait, the alternation is between 4 and 3. For a single zero, it's replaced with 4. For two zeros, 4,3. For three zeros, 4,3,4. For four zeros, 4,3,4,3. \n\nSo in the fifth row of the test input, the zero at position 5 is replaced with 4. The zero at position 9 is replaced with 4. The zeros at positions 11 and 13 are each replaced with 4. \n\nBut wait, if a run of zeros is of length 1, then it's replaced with 4. For a run of 2, 4 and 3. For a run of 3, 4,3,4. And so on. \n\nThus, for each run of zeros between non-zero numbers, replace them with the alternating sequence of 4 and 3, starting with 4. \n\nAnother example: the seventh row of the test input: [8,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8]. The zeros are at positions 3 and 7, 9, 11. \n\nEach of these zeros is a single zero between 8s. So replaced with 4. \n\nThus, the output would be [8,8,8,4,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,8,8].\n\nAnother example: the third row of the test input: [0,8,0,0,0,0,4,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]. \n\nThe leading zero at position 0 is not between non-zero numbers (only after 8), so it remains 0. \n\nThe zeros at positions 2-5 are between 8 (position 1) and 4 (position 6). So a run of 4 zeros. Replaced with 4,3,4,3. \n\nThe zeros at positions 9-13 are between 8 (position 8) and 8 (position 14). So a run of 5 zeros. Replaced with 4,3,4,3,4. \n\nSo the third row's output would be: [0,8,4,3,4,3,4,3,8,4,3,4,3,4,8].\n\nBut according to this, the zeros between 8 and 4 are replaced. But 4 is not 8, so does the replacement only happen when the zeros are between the same numbers, or between any non-zero numbers? \n\nLooking at Example 0's first row, the zeros are between 8 and 8. In Example 1's first row, the zeros between 8 and 8 are replaced. Also, in Example 1's eighth row input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]. The output has zeros replaced between 8 and 8. \n\nBut in the third row of the test input, the zeros between 8 and 4 (different numbers) are being replaced. So the rule is that any run of zeros between any two non-zero elements is replaced, regardless of what those non-zero elements are. \n\nSo that's the case. So in the test input's third row, the zeros between 8 and 4 are replaced. \n\nPutting it all together, the test input's rows would have their between non-zero zero runs replaced with alternating 4 and 3, starting with 4. \n\nNow, let's apply this to each row of the test input and generate the output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at the training examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output, I notice that some zeros in the input are replaced by numbers like 2, 3 in the output. For instance, in the first input row of Example 0, the input starts with [8,0,0,0,0,0,8,...], and the output is [8,3,2,3,2,3,8,...]. So the zeros between the 8s are being replaced in a sequence like 3,2,3,2,3. Hmm, alternating 3 and 2?\n\nSimilarly, in the second input row of Example 0, the input starts with [0,0,8,8,8,0,...], and the output starts with [3,2,8,8,8,2,...]. So the two zeros become 3 and 2. Then the next zero is replaced with 2. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where zeros are replaced by alternating 3 and 2, but how does that start?\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, whenever there's a sequence of zeros, they are replaced by alternating 3 and 2. For example, a longer sequence of zeros might become 3,2,3,2, etc. But how does the alternation start? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the first row of Example 0's input: the five zeros after the initial 8. The output is 3,2,3,2,3. So starting with 3, then alternating. Then the next zero in that row (position 12) remains 0. Wait, but why? Maybe the rule is that only certain zeros are replaced. Maybe zeros that are adjacent to non-zero numbers, or part of a path?\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is related to replacing zeros that are part of certain paths with numbers that alternate between 3 and 2. But how to determine which zeros are replaced.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. For instance, the first input row is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8], and the output becomes [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,1,4,1,4,1,8]. So the trailing zeros after the 8 in the input (positions 8-12) are replaced with 1,4,1,4,1. So here, the pattern alternates between 1 and 4. So perhaps different numbers are used in different examples. \n\nWait, in Example 0, the numbers used were 2 and 3. In Example 1, they're 1 and 4. What's different between the two examples? Looking at the inputs, maybe the presence of other numbers. In Example 0, there's a 3 and a 2 in the input (like in row 6, position 17: 3). But in Example 1's input, there's a 1,4, etc. So perhaps the numbers used to replace zeros depend on existing numbers in the input. For instance, in Example 0, the 3 and 2 are already present, so maybe the replacement alternates between the next higher or lower numbers. But this is getting a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is creating a gradient or a path from a certain number. For instance, in Example 1's input, the 4 and 1 are present in the lower rows (like row 8 has 1, row 9 has 4). The output in row 0 of Example 1's output replaces some zeros with 1 and 4. So perhaps when there's a number (like 1 or 4), the zeros leading up to it are replaced with alternating numbers, starting from that number and alternating with another. For example, in row 8 of Example 1's input, there's a 1. Then in the output, the zeros before it (positions 8-12) in the first row become 1,4,1,4,1. So starting from 1, then alternating 4,1, etc. Similarly, in row 9 of the input, there's a 4, and in the output, the preceding zeros might be 4,1,4,1, etc. Wait, looking at row 9 in Example 1's output: [8,8,0,8,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,8,0]. So the zeros after the 4 in the input (position 5 and beyond) are replaced with 1 and 4 alternately. So maybe when there's a number (like 1 or 4), the zeros in the same row before it are replaced in a sequence that alternates starting from that number and another, perhaps the next in a cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement numbers are determined by adjacent numbers. For example, if a zero is adjacent to a 3 and 2, then it alternates between them. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 3 and 2 in Example 0's output could be part of a path leading towards the 3 and 2 in the input. For example, in the input of Example 0, row 7 (input) has [...,3,2,3,...], and the output's row 7 has a sequence of 3,2,3,2,3,2,3. So maybe the zeros along the path leading to that 3 and 2 are being replaced with alternating numbers.\n\nAlternatively, think of the zeros as paths that are being filled with numbers in a certain order. For example, the zeros that are in a contiguous block adjacent to a number (like 3 or 2) are replaced by a sequence starting from that number and alternating with another. For instance, in Example 0's first row, the sequence of zeros between 8 and 8s is replaced with 3,2,3,2,3. So 3 and 2 alternate. Maybe the direction matters here. Like, if you have a sequence of zeros that's a path leading to a 3, then the numbers alternate between 3 and 2, perhaps decreasing each step. Alternatively, the numbers could be part of a countdown or some pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the input has a zero and the output has a non-zero. Let's see in Example 0's first row:\n\nInput: [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n\nOutput: [8, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n\nSo the first five zeros (positions 1-5) become 3,2,3,2,3. The zero at position 12 remains 0. The zero at position 16 becomes 2. Then position 19 remains 0. So why are some zeros replaced and others not?\n\nLooking at the output, perhaps the zeros that are adjacent to 8s are being replaced. For example, the zeros between 8s are filled with 3 and 2 alternately. The zero at position 12 is between 8 and 0 (the input has 8,0,8), but in the output, the 0 remains. Hmm. Maybe only zeros that are in a path between certain numbers are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros that are part of a horizontal line between two 8s are being filled with alternating numbers. For instance, the first five zeros are between 8 and 8, so they form a bridge, and are filled with 3,2,3,2,3. Then the next zero (position 12) is between 8 and 0 (input) so it's not part of a bridge between 8s, hence remains 0.\n\nIn the seventh row of Example 0's input:\n\nInput: [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nOutput: [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 8, 0]\n\nHere, the zeros after the 8 (position 9) in the input are replaced starting from 3, then 2,3,2, etc., leading up to the existing 3,2,3. So the replacement seems to start from the existing 3 and work backwards, filling the zeros with alternating 3 and 2.\n\nThis suggests that whenever there's a sequence of zeros adjacent to a number (like 3 or 2), the zeros are replaced in a pattern that alternates between that number and another, extending towards the start or end of the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros in the input are part of a path that connects certain numbers, and the pattern fills those paths with alternating numbers. For example, if a path of zeros leads to a 3, the path is filled with 3 and 2 alternately.\n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a 1 and 4 in rows 8 and 9. In the output, the zeros leading up to those numbers are replaced with alternating 1 and 4. For example, the first row's output ends with 1,4,1,4,1. So starting from the 8 at position 7, the zeros after that are replaced with 1,4,1,4,1 leading up to the 8. But how does that relate to the 1 and 4 in lower rows?\n\nAnother angle: the numbers used in the output are existing in the input. For Example 0, the input has 3 and 2. The output uses those to replace zeros. For Example 1, the input has 1 and 4, and the output uses those. So perhaps the rule is that when a row in the input has a number (like 3,2 or 1,4), the zeros in adjacent positions are replaced with those numbers in an alternating pattern, starting from the existing number and moving outward.\n\nBut how to determine the direction. Let's look at Example 0's row 7. The input has [..., 3,2,3, ...] and the output expands that into a longer sequence of 3,2,3,2,3, etc. So maybe when there's a sequence like 3,2,3, the zeros before it are filled in reverse order. Like, the zeros leading up to the 3 are replaced with the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is replacing zeros that are connected (adjacent) to certain numbers, and the replacement alternates between those numbers in a specific order. For example, if a zero is adjacent to a 3, it becomes 3, then the next zero becomes 2, and so on.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's first row, the input has a series of zeros between 8s. The output starts with 3, then 2, then 3, etc. So perhaps the starting number is 3, then alternates with 2. Where does the 3 come from? Maybe from the existing numbers in the input. In Example 0's input, the number 3 appears in row 6, position 17. So maybe the 3 is a seed, and the zeros in the path leading to it are replaced with 3 and 2 alternately.\n\nBut the first row's zeros in Example 0 are replaced with 3 and 2, but how are they connected to the 3 in row 6? That's several rows below. Maybe the entire grid is considered, and the 3s and 2s in the input act as sources for propagating these numbers along paths of zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the output are determined by their Manhattan distance from certain key numbers in the input, with alternating values based on even and odd distances. But this might be too complex.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the input and output for each example row by row, looking for patterns.\n\nTake Example 0's first input row:\n\nInput: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,0]\n\nOutput: [8,3,2,3,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,2,8,8,0,8,8,8,0]\n\nThe zeros between the first 8 and the next 8s (positions 1-5) become 3,2,3,2,3. Then the zero at position 12 remains 0, but the zero at position 16 becomes 2. So maybe the direction matters here. If the zeros are between two 8s horizontally, they are filled with 3 and 2 alternately. But why 3 and 2? Perhaps they are the next available numbers in the input. In Example 0's input, the number 3 is present in row 6, and 2 in row 7.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 3 and 2 are part of a \"wave\" that propagates through the zeros. For example, the 3 and 2 in the input (row 7) are part of a path that spreads out into the surrounding zeros, replacing them with alternating 3 and 2. But how does this spread happen across different rows?\n\nLooking at Example 0's row 7 input:\n\nInput: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,3,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,2,8,0]\n\nHere, the zeros after the 8 (position 9) are replaced with 3,2,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,2. The original 3,2,3 is at positions 16-18. So the zeros to the left of the 3 are replaced with 3 and 2 alternately, leading up to the existing 3. So it's like the existing 3 is the start, and moving left, it alternates with 2.\n\nSimilarly, the zeros in the first row's positions 1-5 are replaced with 3,2,3,2,3. Perhaps this is part of a path leading down to the 3 in row 7. But how?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the key is to look for all occurrences of zeros in the input that are adjacent to non-zero numbers (other than 8) and see how they are replaced. But 8 is a common number in the input. Wait, in both examples, the input has a lot of 8s, which might represent walls or fixed positions, and other numbers (like 0,3,2,1,4) are part of the path.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are part of the structure, and the other numbers are elements that need to be connected through the zeros. The transformation fills the zeros with numbers that form a path connecting these elements, alternating between two specific numbers.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output again, the numbers 1 and 4 are used in the replacement. For example, the first row's output ends with 1,4,1,4,1. These replacements are in positions that were zeros in the input. In the input's row 8, there's a 1, and row 9 has a 4. So the zeros leading up to these numbers are replaced with 1 and 4 alternately. So perhaps the replacement is propagating from those numbers into the zeros, creating a path of alternating numbers.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might be:\n\n- Identify certain key numbers in the input (like 3,2 in Example 0; 1,4 in Example 1).\n- For sequences of zeros that form a path leading to these key numbers, replace the zeros with alternating values of the key numbers in a specific order.\n- The direction of alternation starts from the key number and propagates outward.\n\nSo, in Example 0's row 7, the existing 3 and 2 are surrounded by zeros which are replaced with alternating 3 and 2. The replacement starts with 3 and alternates. Similarly, in Example 1's row 8 and 9, the 1 and 4 are surrounded by zeros which are replaced with alternating 1 and 4.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nLooking at the test input, there's a 4 and a 3 in the third row: [0,8,0,0,0,0,4,3,8,...]. So the key numbers here are 4 and 3. Following the pattern from the examples, the zeros leading up to these numbers should be replaced with alternating 4 and 3. But wait, in Example 0, the numbers were 3 and 2, and they alternated starting with 3. In Example 1, the numbers were 1 and 4, and alternated starting with 1. So perhaps the order is determined by the existing numbers in the input. For instance, in Example 0, the 3 comes before the 2 in the input, so the alternation starts with 3. In Example 1, the 1 comes before the 4, so the alternation starts with 1.\n\nBut in the test input's third row, the numbers are 4 and 3. So if the order is based on their positions, the 4 comes before the 3. So the alternation would start with 4 and then 3? Or does it depend on their order in the input sequence? Let's see.\n\nIn the test input's third row: [0,8,0,0,0,0,4,3,8,...]. The numbers 4 and 3 are adjacent. So perhaps the alternation starts with 4 and then 3. So zeros leading up to this pair would be replaced with 4,3,4,3, etc. But how far does this replacement go? For example, the zeros before 4,3 in the third row would be replaced in reverse order, starting from the 4 and moving left.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's row 7 again: the existing 3,2,3 in the input. The zeros to the left of this sequence are replaced with 3,2,3,2, etc., leading up to the existing 3. So the replacement starts from the existing numbers and works backward. So in the test input's third row, after the 4 and 3, the zeros to the left (positions 2-5) would be replaced starting with 3, then 4, then 3, etc. Wait, but that doesn't fit the previous examples. Alternatively, the direction might depend on the order of the existing numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement alternates between the two numbers in the order they appear. For example, in Example 0's row 7, the existing numbers are 3,2,3. So the alternation is between 3 and 2. The zeros to the left are filled with 3,2,3,2,... leading up to the existing 3. So the first replaced zero is 3, then 2, etc.\n\nIn the test input's third row, the existing numbers are 4 followed by 3. So the alternation would be 4 and 3. The zeros before them (positions 2-5) would be filled as 4,3,4,3. Let's check:\n\nTest input row 3: [0,8,0,0,0,0,4,3,8,...] \u2192 Output would have [0,8,4,3,4,3,4,3,8,...] ?\n\nBut let's look at the training examples for confirmation. For example, in Example 1's row 9 input: [8,8,0,8,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]. The output is [8,8,0,8,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,8,0]. So the zeros after the 1 are replaced with 4 and 1 alternately. Wait, the existing numbers are 4 and 1 (positions 4 and 5). Then the zeros are replaced with 4,1,4,1. But the existing 1 is followed by zeros. The replacement starts with 4, then 1, etc. So maybe the order is determined by the first number encountered when moving through the zeros. For example, if the path of zeros leads to a 4 and then a 1, the alternation starts with 4.\n\nAlternatively, in Example 1's first row, the zeros after position 7 (which is an 8) are replaced with 1,4,1,4,1. The existing 1 and 4 are in row 8 and 9. So maybe the alternation starts with the lower number first. Or perhaps it's based on the order in which the numbers appear in the grid.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to formulate a possible rule based on the training examples:\n\nRule:\n- When a sequence of zeros in the input is adjacent to or leads to a pair of numbers (like 3 and 2, 1 and 4), those zeros are replaced with an alternating sequence of those numbers, starting with the first number encountered in the input.\n\nSo in Example 0's row 7, the input has 3,2,3. The zeros to the left of this sequence are replaced with 3,2,3,2, etc. So starting with 3.\n\nIn Example 1's row 9 input: 4,1. The zeros after that are replaced with 4,1,4,1, etc. So starting with 4.\n\nIn the test input's third row, the numbers are 4,3. So the zeros before them would be replaced with 4,3,4,3.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input:\n\nTest input third row: [0,8,0,0,0,0,4,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nThe zeros from position 2 to 5 (0,0,0,0) would become 4,3,4,3. Then the existing 4,3 would follow. So the output for this row would be [0,8,4,3,4,3,4,3,8, ...].\n\nBut looking at the rest of the row, after the 8, there's 0,0,0,0,0,8. How are those zeros handled? Are there any numbers after them? The rest of the row is 8,0,0,0,0,0,8. If there's no number after these zeros, maybe they remain zeros unless there's a number elsewhere influencing them.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the training examples, the replacement seems to happen in contiguous sequences of zeros that are adjacent to the numbers. So perhaps the zeros must form a continuous path leading to the numbers.\n\nNow, looking at the test input's second row: [0,8,0,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The 4 is here. So zeros adjacent to this 4 would be replaced with 4 and another number. But which number? The other number in the test input is 3 in row 3. So maybe the alternation is between 4 and 3.\n\nBut how do we know which numbers to pair? In Example 0, the pairs were 3 and 2. In Example 1, 1 and 4. So the pairs seem to be the numbers present in the input. In the test input, the numbers are 4,3, and perhaps others. Let's check the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 1: [0,8,0,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 has a 4.\n\nRow 2: [0,8,0,0,0,0,4,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,8] \u2192 has 4 and 3.\n\nRow 3: [0,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,0,8,8,8] \u2192 has 4.\n\nRow 7: [8,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8] \u2192 no numbers other than 8 and 0.\n\nRow 9: [8,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8] \u2192 no numbers.\n\nOther rows have zeros and 8s, except row 2 and 3 which have 4 and 3.\n\nSo perhaps the pairs here are 4 and 3. So zeros adjacent to these would be replaced with alternating 4 and 3.\n\nSo for example, in row 2 of the test input:\n\nInput: [0,8,0,0,0,0,4,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nThe zeros before 4 and 3 (positions 2-5) would be replaced starting with 4 and 3 alternately. So positions 2-5 become 4,3,4,3. Then the existing 4 and 3 follow. The zeros after the 8 (positions 9-13) are all zeros. Are they replaced? Since there's no number after them except 8, perhaps they remain 0 unless there's another number affecting them. But in the test input's third row (row 3), there's a 4, but it's in the same row. Let's see:\n\nRow 3 input: [0,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,0,8,8,8]\n\nThe 4 is at position 7. The zeros after it (position 11) is 0, but the rest are 8s. So maybe the zero at position 11 is replaced with 4 and 3 alternately if there's a path leading to another number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement only happens for zeros that are between two numbers. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the numbers in the output are a result of \"filling\" the zeros with alternating numbers based on the numbers present in the same row or column. For example, if a row has a 4 and 3, then zeros in that row are filled with 4 and 3 alternately, starting from the position of the numbers.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. To proceed, perhaps I can hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing sequences of zeros with alternating pairs of numbers present in the input, starting with the first encountered number and alternating with the second.\n\nIn the test input, the numbers present are 4 and 3 (in row 2), so the alternating pair is 4 and 3. Therefore, sequences of zeros leading to these numbers would be replaced starting with 4, then 3, then 4, etc.\n\nApplying this to the test input's row 2:\n\nInput: [0,8,0,0,0,0,4,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nThe zeros at positions 2,3,4,5 (values 0,0,0,0) are replaced with 4,3,4,3. The next positions 6-7 are 4 and 3. Then the zeros after 8 (positions 9-13) are all zeros. Since they are after an 8 and before another 8, but there's no numbers (like 4 or 3) nearby, perhaps they remain 0. So the output for this row would be:\n\n[0,8,4,3,4,3,4,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nBut wait, the original input has 4,3 at positions 6 and 7. The preceding zeros are replaced with 4,3,4,3. Then the existing 4 and 3. The following zeros after 8 (position 8) are all zeros. Unless there's another number in the following positions influencing them.\n\nLooking at row 3 of the test input:\n\n[0,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,0,8,8,8]\n\nThe zero at position 11. Since there's a 4 in position 7, perhaps this zero is part of a path leading to the 4. So maybe the zero is replaced with 3 (alternating after 4). But this is a single zero. Not sure.\n\nAnother example: in Example 0's row 7, the zeros after position 9 (which is 8) are replaced with 3,2,3,2,... leading up to the existing 3. So the replacement starts from the existing numbers and works backwards.\n\nIn the test input's row 2, the zeros before 4 and 3 are replaced with 4,3,4,3. Then the 4 and 3 remain as is. The zeros after the 8 (position 8) may not be replaced unless there's another number later.\n\nAnother example to check: in Example 1's first row, the zeros after the 8 at position 7 are replaced with 1,4,1,4,1. The numbers 1 and 4 are present in lower rows. So the replacement is propagating upwards. So perhaps the direction isn't limited to the same row.\n\nThis suggests that the entire grid is considered, and zeros that form a path leading to certain numbers are replaced with alternating numbers based on those in the grid.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to look for all occurrences of zeros in the test input that are adjacent (in any direction) to non-zero numbers (other than 8) and replace them with alternating values of those numbers. But this requires considering the grid in 2D, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that whenever a zero is between two non-zero numbers (other than 8), it's replaced with alternating values. But this may not capture all cases.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that the zeros are replaced with numbers that alternate between the smallest and largest non-8 numbers present in the input. For Example 0, the non-8 numbers are 3 and 2. So alternates between 3 and 2. In Example 1, non-8 numbers are 1 and 4. So alternates between 1 and 4. In the test input, non-8 numbers are 4 and 3, so alternate between 4 and 3.\n\nBut why in Example 0's first row, the alternation starts with 3 and then 2? Because 3 is larger than 2. Or perhaps the order is determined by the order they appear in the input.\n\nIn Example 0's input, 3 appears before 2 in row 6. So maybe the alternation starts with the first encountered number.\n\nIn the test input's row 2, 4 appears before 3. So alternation would start with 4, then 3.\n\nIf this is the case, then the replacement for zeros in the test input would alternate between 4 and 3.\n\nApplying this:\n\nIn the test input's row 2, the zeros before 4 and 3 would become 4,3,4,3.\n\nIn other rows where there's a 4 or 3, the zeros nearby would be replaced accordingly.\n\nFor example, row 1 of the test input has a 4. If there's a sequence of zeros leading to this 4, they would be replaced with 4 and 3 alternately. Let's see:\n\nTest input row 1: [0,8,0,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThe 4 is at position 7. The zeros before it are at positions 0,2. But position 0 is 0, followed by 8. Position 2 is 0, between 8 and 8. Are these zeros replaced? If so, perhaps position 2 (0) is between 8s, so replaced with 4,3 alternately. But where does the 4 come from? The 4 is at position 7. But there's no clear path of zeros between position 2 and 7.\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to apply the following heuristic:\n\n- For each zero in the input, if it is part of a horizontal or vertical sequence of zeros that leads to a pair of numbers (like 4 and 3 in the test input), replace the zeros in that sequence with alternating 4 and 3, starting from the number that appears first in the input.\n\nIn the test input's row 2, the 4 comes before the 3, so the sequence would start with 4.\n\nSo the output for row 2 would be:\n\n[0,8,4,3,4,3,4,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nSimilarly, other rows with zeros adjacent to 4 or 3 would be replaced.\n\nLooking at row 3 of the test input: [0,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,0,8,8,8]\n\nThe zero at position 11. If there's a path leading to the 4 at position 7, perhaps this zero is part of that path. But between 4 and the zero, there are 8s. So maybe no replacement.\n\nNow, considering the test input's row 7:\n\n[8,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8]\n\nIf there's a 0 that's adjacent to a number other than 8, but in the test input, there are no other numbers besides 4,3. So maybe these zeros are not replaced.\n\nIn the test input's row 9:\n\n[8,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8]\n\nThe zeros here are not adjacent to 4 or 3, so they remain 0.\n\nPutting this all together, the test output would have the following changes:\n\n- In row 2, positions 2-5 replaced with 4,3,4,3.\n\n- In row 3, maybe the zero at position 11 is replaced with 4 or 3 if there's a path.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to be certain. However, based on the training examples, the key is to find sequences of zeros leading to the numbers and replace them with alternating numbers starting with the first encountered.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed to generate the test output based on this hypothesis.",
