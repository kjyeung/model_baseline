        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output in these examples. Let me start by looking at the training examples to see what's changing.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output, I notice that some of the numbers are changing. For instance, in the input, there are 1s in certain positions, and in the output, those 1s become 2s. Like in row 7, the 1 in the input becomes a 2 in the output. Similarly, the group of 1s in rows 8-9 become 2s. But there are also 1s that stay the same, like in row 12, the 1s remain 1s. Hmm, so maybe there's a condition for when the 1s get changed to 2s.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 1s that get converted to 2s are in a cross shape? Let me check. The input's row 7 has a single 1, then rows 8 have three 1s, and row 9 has a single 1 again. That looks like a vertical line of 1s. But in the output, those become 2s. Then in the same example, further down, there's a horizontal line of 1s in row 12, which stays as 1s. So maybe the vertical clusters of 1s are being changed to 2s, but horizontal ones are left as 1s? Or maybe it's related to their position relative to other numbers like 5 or 2?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has 1s that are in a horizontal line (rows 9-11), and in the output, those become 3s. But in another part (rows 16-18), the 1s are part of a cross (like a small pyramid), and they remain 1s. Wait, in the output of Example 1, the 1s in the cross pattern (rows 9-11) are changed to 3s, while other 1s in different patterns stay as 1s. Hmm, maybe the numbers are being incremented based on some surrounding structure or their own cluster's shape.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0, the input has some 2s. Those 2s in the input remain 2s in the output. So maybe the transformation is only applied to 1s. Wait, in Example 0's output, the 2s are part of the input and remain, but the 1s are converted. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s in the input stay as 3s, and the 1s in certain areas become 3s. Wait no, in Example 1's input, there are 3s in the first part (rows 3-5) which are part of a square structure, and those stay as 3s. Then later, some 1s in a horizontal line become 3s. So maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a cross-shaped cluster (like a vertical line of three 1s with a single in the middle?), those 1s are converted to the next number (like 2 in Example 0, 3 in Example 1). But how is the target number determined?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output converts 1s to 2s. In Example 1, 1s are converted to 3s. In Example 2, 1s become 2s again. Example 3 converts some 1s to 3s. So maybe the target number depends on the highest number present in the input? Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input has 5, 0, 2, and 1. The highest is 5. The converted 1s become 2, which is lower than 5. But in Example 1, the input has 5 and 3. The converted 1s become 3. The highest is 5 again. So maybe the target number is the highest number minus something? Or maybe the next number after the highest in some sequence.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0: the input has 5, 2, 0, 1. The converted 1s to 2. So 2 is present in the input. Example 1's input has 5, 3, 0, 1. Converted 1s to 3. So the target number is the next higher number after the existing ones? Or perhaps the target is the maximum number in the input minus 3? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the target number is the same as the maximum number in certain regions. For example, in Example 0, the 1s that are converted are in regions surrounded by 5s. Wait, in Example 0's input, the 1s that are converted are in rows 7-9, which are separate from the 5s. But the output converts them to 2s. The 5s form a frame around the other numbers. Maybe the 1s that are in certain shapes (like vertical lines) are replaced by the number that's one less than the maximum number in the input. The maximum in Example 0 is 5, 5-3=2? Wait 5-3=2? That might not be a pattern. Or maybe it's the maximum number in a certain area. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that when a 1 is part of a vertical line of three (like a single 1 in the middle of a vertical line), then it's replaced by the next higher number. But in Example 0, the vertical line of 1s (row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,...]) is changed to 2. Then rows 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,...] becomes 2,2,2. So perhaps any cluster of 1s that forms a vertical line (like a cross) is replaced by the next number after the maximum number in the input. Wait, in Example 0, max is 5. The replaced 1s become 2. So 5-3=2? Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1: input has max 5 and 3. The 1s in a horizontal line (rows 9-11) become 3. So maybe the number is the same as another existing number in the input. In Example 1, there's a structure with 3s, and the 1s in a certain area are converted to 3. Similarly, in Example 3, some 1s become 3s, and there are 3s in the input. So maybe the 1s are being converted to the number that is present in the same structure or region. For example, in Example 0, there's a 2 in the input (rows 2-4), and the 1s are converted to 2. In Example 1, the 3s are present, and the 1s become 3. Example 2 has 2s in the input and the 1s become 2. Example 3 has 3s and some 1s become 3, but others stay as 1. So perhaps the 1s are converted to the number of the surrounding area. Like, if the 1s are near 5s, they become 2? Or perhaps it's based on the highest number in the same structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure in the input (like the 5s forming a frame) and the 1s inside that frame are converted to a different number. But in Example 0, the 5s form a border, and the 1s are outside, yet they get converted. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the conversion of 1s to a higher number (like 2 or 3) depends on their position relative to other numbers. For example, if the 1s are in a vertical line, they are converted to the next number. Or maybe it's a matter of their proximity to certain numbers. But how?\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the changes between input and output. In all examples, the output is almost the same as the input except certain 1s are replaced by a higher number (2 or 3). So the key is to find which 1s are replaced and why.\n\nIn Example 0, the 1s that are replaced form a vertical line (rows 7-9, columns 11-13?), which becomes 2s. The other 1s in row 12 (horizontal line) remain 1s. So perhaps vertical lines of 1s are replaced with the next number (like 2), while horizontal lines stay. But in Example 1, the 1s in a horizontal line (rows 9-11) are replaced with 3s. Wait, that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait in Example 1's input, the 1s in rows 9-11 form three rows of [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0], which is a horizontal line. In the output, they become 3s. So maybe the direction isn't the factor. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the numbers again: in Example 0, the 1s turned into 2. The input has 2s present. In Example 1, 1s turned into 3, which is present in the input. Example 2's 1s turn into 2 (input has 2s). Example 3: some 1s become 3 (input has 3s). So the pattern could be that any 1 that is adjacent (in some way) to a number N is replaced by N. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are part of a cross-shaped cluster (like a vertical line of three 1s with a single in the middle) and are replaced by the maximum number present in their surrounding area. Or perhaps the maximum number in the entire input. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input has max 5, but the 1s become 2. So maybe not the global maximum. Example 1's input has max 5, and the 1s become 3. So 3 is present in the input. Example 2's input has max 5, and 1s become 2. Example 3's input has max 5, and some 1s become 3. So it's possible that the replacement number is a number present in the input, perhaps the highest after 5. But in Example 0, the replacement is 2, which is present. Example 1 uses 3, which is present. So maybe the 1s are being replaced by the next highest number available in the input. For example, in Example 0, after 5, the next is 2, then 1. So maybe the highest non-5 number. But in Example 0, the highest after 5 is 2. In Example 1, the highest after 5 is 3. So that would fit. Then, in the output, the 1s are replaced with the next highest number in the input.\n\nLet me verify this. For Example 0, input numbers are 5, 2, 1, 0. The next highest after 5 is 2. So 1s become 2. Example 1: numbers are 5, 3, 1, 0. Next highest after 5 is 3. So 1s become 3. Example 2: numbers 5, 2, 1, 0. Next highest after 5 is 2. 1s become 2. Example 3: numbers 5,3,1,0. 1s become 3. So that seems consistent.\n\nSo the pattern could be: replace all 1s with the next highest number present in the input (excluding 5). Wait, but how do we know which number to pick? Let's check each example's numbers:\n\nExample 0's input has 5,2,1. So the next highest after 5 is 2. So 1s are replaced with 2.\n\nExample 1's input has 5,3,1. Next highest is 3. So 1s become 3.\n\nExample 2's input has 5,2,1. Replace with 2.\n\nExample 3's input has 5,3,1. Replace with 3.\n\nYes, that fits. So the rule is: for each input, find the maximum number (which is 5 in all examples), then the next highest number (which is 2,3, etc.) and replace all 1s with that next highest number. But wait, in Example 0's output, there are 1s that remain. For example, in row 12, there's [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0...] which remains as 1s. Wait, but according to this rule, all 1s should be replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the 1s in row 12 (input's row 12) are still present. So the rule isn't to replace all 1s, but only certain ones. So maybe the replacement isn't global. Then what's different between the 1s that get replaced and those that don't?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: the 1s in rows 7-9 are replaced, but the 1s in row 12 are not. The row 12 1s are a horizontal line of four. The replaced 1s form a vertical cross. So maybe the shape of the 1s cluster determines whether they are replaced. Like vertical clusters are replaced, horizontal are not. But in Example 1, the 1s that are replaced are in a horizontal line (rows 9-11), which become 3s. So that contradicts the shape idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s that are adjacent to 5s are replaced. Let's check. In Example 0's input, the 1s in rows 7-9 are not near 5s. The 5s form a frame around the top-left. The 1s in rows 7-9 are in the middle-right. The 1s in row 12 are in the lower-left. So proximity to 5s might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s that are part of a certain structure, like being surrounded by 0s, are replaced. But that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement happens to 1s that are part of a certain size or shape. For example, in Example 0's input, the 1s that are replaced form a vertical line of three (rows 7,8,9), which is a small cross. In Example 1, the replaced 1s are a horizontal line of three (rows 9-11). So maybe any cluster of 1s (like a line of three) is replaced with the next highest number. But then why in Example 0's input, the row 12's horizontal line of four 1s isn't replaced. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s that are not part of the main structure (like the 5s' frame) are replaced. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are replaced when they are in certain regions of the grid. For example, in Example 0, the replaced 1s are in the upper part, but the ones in the lower part (row 12) aren't. But this is arbitrary.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's look at the test input and see what needs to be transformed. The test input has some 1s and 2s. The highest number is 5. The next highest is 2. So according to the previous pattern, the 1s would be replaced with 2. Let's see.\n\nIn the test input, there are 1s in rows 2-4 (like [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,0,2,2,2,0,0] etc.), and other 1s in rows 9-12. If the pattern is to replace all 1s with the next highest number after 5, which is 2 here, then those 1s would become 2s.\n\nBut wait, looking at the test input's numbers: the numbers present are 5,2,1,0. So the next highest after 5 is 2. So replacing all 1s with 2. But in the test input, there are also 2s. So in the output, the 1s become 2s, and existing 2s remain.\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the replaced 1s sometimes become a higher number, but existing numbers (like 2 or 3) are not changed. So the test input's 1s would become 2s.\n\nLooking at the test input's structure, the 1s are in various places. For example, row 2 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,0,2,2,2,0,0]. The 1s here are three in a row. According to the previous examples, these might be replaced with 2. Similarly, other 1s in the test input would become 2s.\n\nBut let's check the test input's structure. For example, the 5s are arranged in a frame in the lower rows (rows 13-19). The test input's rows 13-19 have a frame similar to the training examples. So maybe the 1s that are outside of this frame are replaced, while those inside are not? Or vice versa?\n\nAlternatively, the test input's 1s are in different areas. Let's list the positions of 1s in the test input:\n\n- Row 2: columns 7-9 (three 1s)\n- Row 3: columns 7-9 (three 1s)\n- Row 8: column 7-8 (two 1s)\n- Row 9: columns 3 and 7-10 (1s)\n- Row 10: columns 2-4 and 7-10 (multiple 1s)\n- Row 11: columns 2-3 and 7-8 (1s)\n- Row 15: column 15 (1)\n- Row 17: column 15 (1)\n\nSo, if the pattern is to replace all 1s with 2s (since the next highest number after 5 is 2 in the test input), then in the output, all these 1s would become 2s. Existing 2s would remain 2s. For example, in row 2 of the test input's output, the 1s in columns 7-9 would become 2s. The existing 2s in columns 15-17 would stay as 2s.\n\nLooking at the training examples again, in Example 0, the 1s that were replaced were all the ones that formed a vertical line (rows 7-9), and other 1s (row 12) were left as 1. But according to the previous hypothesis, all 1s should be replaced. This suggests that the initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nSo there's a contradiction. Let's re-examine Example 0. In the input, there are 1s in row 12 (horizontal line of four 1s) that remain 1 in the output. But according to the hypothesis of replacing all 1s with next highest, they should have become 2. So that's a problem. So the pattern must be more nuanced.\n\nLooking again at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput row 12: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row 12: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo these 1s remain. But the other 1s in rows 7-9 and 15-17 are replaced. What's different between them?\n\nIn Example 0, the 1s that are replaced are in a cross or vertical arrangement. The 1s in row 12 are in a horizontal line. So maybe only vertical clusters are replaced. But in Example 1, the replaced 1s are in a horizontal line. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the replaced 1s are those that form a certain shape. For example, in Example 0, the replaced 1s form a vertical cross (single, three, single). In Example 1, the replaced 1s form a horizontal line of three. So it's inconsistent.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the surrounding cells. In Example 0's replaced 1s (rows 7-9), the 1s are in positions where their surrounding cells (above, below, left, right) have zeros. For example, the single 1 in row 7 is surrounded by zeros. The three 1s in row 8 have a 1 above and below. The single 1 in row 9 has zeros around. So maybe isolated 1s or clusters that form a vertical line. But in Example 1's replaced 1s (horizontal line), how do their surroundings look?\n\nIn Example 1's input, rows 9-11 have three 1s in a horizontal line. Their surroundings would have zeros above and below. So maybe any 1s that are in a vertical or horizontal line of three or more are replaced with the next highest number.\n\nBut why in Example 0's row 12, the horizontal line of four 1s remains. That would be four 1s in a row, but they are not replaced. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replaced if they form a certain structure like a \"plus\" sign. For example, three in a vertical line with one in the middle. But in Example 0, rows 7-9: the 1 in row 7, three in row 8, and one in row 9 form a vertical line. So maybe that's considered a cross. But in Example 1, the 1s are horizontal. So perhaps any cluster of 1s that forms a cross (like a vertical or horizontal line with length 3) is replaced with the next highest number.\n\nBut then why in Example 0's row 12, the four horizontal 1s are not replaced. Maybe because they are longer than 3? Or maybe it's another condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are replaced if they are in a region that is enclosed by 5s. For example, in Example 0, the replaced 1s are not enclosed by 5s. The 5s form a border but the 1s are outside. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement happens only to 1s that are adjacent to 5s. But in Example 0, the replaced 1s are not adjacent to 5s. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a different approach. Maybe each example has a certain \"main\" structure (like a frame of 5s) and the 1s that are part of other structures are replaced with the next highest number. For example, in Example 0, there are 2s inside the 5 frame, and the 1s outside are replaced with 2. In Example 1, the 3s are inside the 5 frame, and the 1s outside are replaced with 3. So the replacement number is the number used inside the 5 frame.\n\nSo the pattern could be: the 5s form a frame or structure, and inside that structure, there's another number (like 2 or 3). The 1s outside the 5 structure are replaced with the number from inside the 5 structure.\n\nIn Example 0, the 5 frame has 2s inside. The 1s outside are replaced with 2. In Example 1, the 5 frame has 3s inside, so 1s are replaced with 3. Example 2's 5 frame has 2s, so 1s become 2. Example 3's 5 frame has 3s inside, so 1s become 3.\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's verify:\n\nExample 0's input has a 5 frame with 2s inside. The 1s outside are replaced with 2.\n\nExample 1's input has a 5 frame with 3s inside. The 1s outside are replaced with 3.\n\nExample 2's input has a 5 frame with 2s inside. The 1s outside are replaced with 2.\n\nExample 3's input has a 5 frame with 3s inside. The 1s outside are replaced with 3.\n\nSo the rule is: identify the number present inside the 5-enclosed structure, and replace all 1s outside of this structure with that number.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0, the replaced 1s are not inside the 5 frame. The 5 frame is in the top-left, and the 1s are in the middle-right. So the 1s are outside the 5 frame. The 2s are inside the 5 frame, so the 1s outside are replaced with 2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the 3s are inside the 5 frame, and the 1s outside are replaced with 3.\n\nBut how to determine which number is inside the 5 frame?\n\nThe 5 frame forms a rectangle. For example, in Example 0, the 5 frame is a 7x7 square. Inside it, there are 2s. So the number inside is 2. The 1s outside are replaced with 2.\n\nIn Example 1, the 5 frame is a different shape but contains 3s inside. So the number inside is 3, so 1s outside become 3.\n\nSo the pattern is: the 1s that are outside the 5-enclosed structures are replaced with the number that is inside those 5 structures. If there are multiple numbers inside, perhaps the highest one. For example, in Example 0, there's 2 inside. In Example 1, 3.\n\nSo for the test input, we need to find the number inside the 5 frame and replace the 1s outside with that number.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows 13-19, there's a 5 frame forming a structure. Let's see:\n\nRow 13: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow 14: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow 15: [0,0,2,2,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,2,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow 16: [0,2,2,2,2,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,2,2,0,5,0]\n\nRow 17: [0,2,2,2,2,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,2,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow 18: [0,0,2,2,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow 19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nThis looks like two separate 5-enclosed structures. The left one is rows 13-19, columns 0-6, and the right one is columns 12-19. Inside these frames, there are 2s. For example, row 15 has 2s. So the number inside the 5 frames is 2. Therefore, any 1s outside these 5 structures should be replaced with 2.\n\nLooking back at the test input's rows 0-12, which are outside the 5 frames, there are 1s in rows 2,3,4,8,9,10,11, etc. According to the pattern, these 1s should be replaced with 2.\n\nSo the expected output would have those 1s turned into 2s. Existing 2s (like in row 15) would remain 2s. The 5s and 0s stay the same.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be the test input with all 1s outside the 5 structures replaced with 2.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has some 1s and 2s, and the output seems to replace certain 1s with 2s. For instance, in rows where there's a cross-like shape of 1s (like three 1s in a vertical line), they become 2s. Similarly, in the lower part of the input, some isolated 1s are turned into 2s. The numbers 5 and existing 2s remain unchanged. So maybe the pattern is that when a 1 is part of a vertical or horizontal line of three (like a small cross), it's replaced with 2. But I need to check other examples to confirm.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has 1s and 3s. The output changes some 1s to 3s. For example, in the rows near the bottom, there's a group of three 1s in a horizontal line that becomes three 3s. Also, the 3s in the input (like the 3,3,3 lines) remain the same. So it seems that the pattern is replacing the number 1 with the next higher number present in the structure. Wait, in Example 0, the 1s turned into 2s, and in Example 1, 1s turned into 3s. That suggests that the replacement number might be the next integer higher than the number surrounding the 1s. Or maybe the number that's part of a certain structure.\n\nWait, let's check Example 2. In the input, there are 1s that become 2s in the output. For instance, in rows where there are three 1s in a horizontal line, they become 2s. The existing 2s stay the same. So maybe the rule is that any group of three 1s in a straight line (vertical or horizontal) gets replaced by the next number in the sequence. But in Example 3, the input has 1s that become 3s. Wait, in Example 3's input, there's a structure with 3s, and the 1s in certain positions become 3s. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number depends on the context. Like, if there's a surrounding structure of a certain number, the 1s in that area get replaced by that number. Let's look at Example 0. The 1s that turn into 2s are near the 2s in the input. Wait, in Example 0's input, there are 2s in the upper part, and the 1s in the lower part become 2s. But in the output, those 1s are replaced by 2s. Similarly, in Example 1, the 1s that are near the 3s are replaced by 3s. So maybe the 1s are being replaced by the maximum number present in their vicinity or in the same structure.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 1s that become 2s are part of a cross shape. The original structure with 2s is a cross. The 1s that become 2s form a similar cross but made of 1s. So maybe the pattern is that any cross-shaped group of 1s (three in a vertical line and three in a horizontal line, forming a cross) is replaced by the next higher number. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are part of certain regions that are enclosed by other numbers, and they take the value of the enclosing number. For example, in Example 0, the 1s are inside a 5 border. But no, in the output, the 5s remain, but the 1s become 2s. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the positions where 1s are replaced. In Example 0's input, the 1s are in a vertical line (row 7, columns 10-12?), but in the output, they become 2s. The 2s in the input are part of a cross structure. Wait, maybe the 1s that form a vertical or horizontal line of three are replaced by the number that's present in a similar structure elsewhere. Like, in Example 0, the 2s form a cross, and the 1s forming a cross are replaced by 2s. In Example 1, the 3s form a block, and the 1s forming a cross are replaced by 3s. Similarly, in Example 3, the 3s are part of a structure, and the 1s in a cross become 3s.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: any group of three 1s arranged in a vertical or horizontal line (like a small cross) is replaced by the number that is present in the largest contiguous block or structure within the same region. Or maybe the number that's part of the surrounding border.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, there are 2s and 1s. The output should replace certain 1s with 2s. Let's look at the test input's structure. For example, in row 2 of the test input, there's a horizontal line of three 1s (positions 7,8,9). According to the pattern from training examples, these should be replaced by 2s if that's the surrounding number. But wait, in the test input's lower part, there's a structure with 2s. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the test input's last few rows:\n\nRow 14: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nRow 15: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 0]\n\nSo there are 2s in these rows. The 1s in the upper part (rows 2 and 3) are in a horizontal line. According to the training examples, these might be replaced by 2s. Similarly, in row 9 of the test input, there's a group of 1s in a cross-like shape. Let's look:\n\nRow 9: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 10: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 11: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn row 10, the first three 1s form a horizontal line. So perhaps these become 2s. Similarly, the vertical line in row 9's column 15 (the 1 at [9][15], [10][15], [11][15]) might form a vertical line of three 1s. So those would be replaced by 2s as well.\n\nBut wait, in the test input's upper part, the 2s are part of a structure. The lower part has 2s in rows 14-17. So maybe the 1s are replaced by 2s because that's the dominant number in their vicinity. Alternatively, the 1s are replaced by the next number in sequence based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps whenever there's a cross of 1s (three in a line vertically or horizontally), they are replaced by the next higher number present in the input. For example, in Example 0, 1s become 2s because 2 is present. In Example 1, 1s become 3s because 3 is present. In Example 3, 1s in certain areas become 3s. So the replacement number is the maximum number in the input, or perhaps the number that's part of a certain structure.\n\nLooking at the test input, the numbers present are 0,1,2,5. So the replacement for 1s would be 2, as that's the next number. But in Example 3, the replacement was 3, which was present in the input. So maybe the replacement is the maximum number in the input. Wait, in Example 0, the input has 5, 0, 2, 1. So max is 5, but the replacement is 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is based on the number that forms a certain structure around the 1s. For instance, in Example 0, the 2s form a cross structure, and the 1s that form a cross are replaced by 2s. In Example 1, the 3s form a block, and the 1s in a cross are replaced by 3s. So maybe the 1s are being replaced by the number that forms a similar structure nearby.\n\nIn the test input, the 2s form some structures in the lower rows. The 1s in rows 2 and 3 (columns 7-9) form a horizontal line. If the pattern is to replace such lines with the number that's part of a similar structure in the same input, then since there are 2s in the lower part, maybe those 1s become 2s. Similarly, in row 10, the horizontal line of three 1s would become 2s.\n\nBut how do we determine which number to replace with? Let's think of the training examples again. In each example, the 1s are replaced by a number that's already present in the input. For example, in Example 0, 2 is present, so 1s become 2. In Example 1, 3 is present, so 1s become 3. In Example 2, 2 is present, so 1s become 2. In Example 3, 3 is present, so 1s become 3. So the pattern seems to be that 1s are replaced by the next higher number present in the input. But how is that next higher determined?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the numbers are 0,5,2,1. The next higher after 1 is 2, which is present. So 1s become 2. In Example 1, numbers are 0,5,3,1. Next higher after 1 is 3 (since 2 isn't present?), so 1s become 3. In Example 2, numbers are 0,5,2,1. Next higher is 2. So 1s become 2. Example 3: numbers 0,5,3,1. So 1s become 3. So the pattern could be: replace all 1s with the next higher number present in the entire input. But how do we determine which number that is. For example, in Example 1, 3 is present, so 1s become 3. In the test input, the numbers are 0,1,2,5. So the next higher after 1 is 2. So all 1s would be replaced by 2.\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, in Example 0, not all 1s are replaced. For instance, in the first example's input, some 1s are in a cross shape and get replaced, but others not. Wait no, in Example 0's input, all the 1s are replaced. Looking at the input and output:\n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a line of three 1s (rows 8-10, column 11-13?), and in the output, those become 2s. Also, in the lower part, there's a single 1 that becomes a 2. Wait, maybe all 1s are replaced by the next higher number present in the input. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 1s are all replaced by 2. So the replacement is to turn all 1s into the next higher number present in the input. But how is the next higher determined? For example, in Example 1, the input includes 3, so 1s become 3. In the test input, the next higher after 1 is 2, so all 1s become 2. But looking at the examples, not all 1s are replaced. Wait, no. In Example 0's input, the 1s are all replaced. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input of Example 0:\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow 1: ... 1,1,1 ...\n\nRow 2: ... 1,1,1 ...\n\nRow 7: ... 1 ... \n\nRow 8: ... 1 ... \n\nIn the output, all those 1s become 2s. So the pattern might be that all 1s are replaced by the next higher number present in the input. But in Example 0, the numbers are 0,1,2,5. So next higher after 1 is 2. So 1\u21922.\n\nIn Example 1, numbers are 0,1,3,5. Next higher after 1 is 3, so 1\u21923.\n\nIn Example 2, numbers are 0,1,2,5. 1\u21922.\n\nIn Example 3, numbers are 0,1,3,5. 1\u21923.\n\nTest input has numbers 0,1,2,5. So 1\u21922. So all 1s should become 2s. But looking at the test input's structure, there are 1s in various places, like rows 2,3,4,9,10, etc. So according to this pattern, all 1s should be replaced by 2s.\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, not all 1s are replaced. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal input has 1s in rows 1,2,3 (the three 1s in a line) and then in row 7 (single 1?), but in the output, all those 1s are replaced by 2s. So yes, all 1s are replaced. Similarly, in Example 1, all 1s become 3s. So the pattern is that all instances of 1 are replaced by the next higher integer present in the input. If the next higher integer is not present, perhaps use the next possible. But in all examples, the next higher is present. So for the test input, all 1s should be replaced by 2.\n\nBut wait, let's look at Example 3. The input has a 3, so 1s become 3. Yes. So the rule is: replace all 1s with the smallest integer greater than 1 that is present in the input. If the input has 2, then 2. If the input has 3 but no 2, then 3. So in the test input, since 2 is present, replace all 1s with 2.\n\nBut looking at the test input:\n\nTest input has 2s in rows 14,15,16, etc. So according to this rule, every 1 in the input becomes a 2 in the output. Let's check the test input's 1s.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 three 1s.\n\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 three 1s.\n\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 one 1.\n\nRow 6: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 four 1s (but consecutive?).\n\nRow 9: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 two 1s and then four 1s, but some isolated.\n\nRow 10: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 multiple 1s.\n\nRow 11: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 two 1s.\n\nRow 16: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 0] \u2192 no 1s here.\n\nSo according to the pattern, all these 1s should become 2s. Let's check the training examples again to see if there are any exceptions. For example, in Example 2's input, there's a row with [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which is a single 1. In the output, it remains a 1, but wait no, looking at the output of Example 2, row 10 in input has 1s, and in output they become 2s. Wait, the input row 10 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output row 10 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Wait, no. Wait, in Example 2's input:\n\nRow 10 of input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row 10: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWait, that 1 remains as 1. But according to the previous pattern, it should become 2. So that's a contradiction. So my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nSo there must be a different pattern. Because in Example 2's input, there's a single 1 in row 10 that isn't replaced. But in the output, it's still 1. So the pattern isn't replacing all 1s. So what's different about that 1? Maybe it's not part of a group of three or more 1s. Let's look again.\n\nIn Example 2's input:\n\nRow 10: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row 10: same as input. So the single 1 remains. So the rule must be that only certain 1s are replaced. So the previous idea of replacing all 1s is incorrect.\n\nLooking back at the training examples. Let's see which 1s are replaced.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput has 1s in rows 1,2,3 (three 1s in a vertical line?), and in row 7 (single 1?), and in rows 15-17 (cross-shaped). In the output, all these 1s become 2s. Wait, the output for Example 0 shows that in row 8, the 1 becomes 2, row 9's 1s become 2s, row 10's 1s become 2s, etc.\n\nWait, maybe the 1s that are part of a cross (three in a row vertically or horizontally) are replaced. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 1: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 three 1s horizontally.\n\nRow 2: same as row 1.\n\nRow 3: same as row 1.\n\nWait, no, looking at the input rows for Example 0:\n\nWait, the INPUT for Example 0 is 20 rows. The first few rows are:\n\nRow 0: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,...]\n\nRow 1: [5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [5,0,0,2,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [5,0,2,2,2,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows 1,2,3 all have three 1s in columns 13-15. In the output, those become 2s. Then in row 7 of the input, there's a single 1 in column 11. In the output, it becomes a 2. Then in rows 15-17 of the input, there's a cross-shaped 1: a single 1 in row 15, three in row 16, and a single in row 17. In the output, those become 2s. So even single 1s are replaced. So in that case, why in Example 2's input, the single 1 in row 10 isn't replaced?\n\nAh, looking at Example 2's output, the single 1 in row 10 remains a 1. So what's different? Let's check.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 10: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row 10: same as input.\n\nSo why wasn't this 1 replaced? It's a single 1. So the pattern must be that only 1s that are part of a certain structure (like a cross) are replaced. But then in Example 0's input, even single 1s are replaced. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternative approach: look for specific structures. For example, in the training examples, whenever there's a cross of three 1s (either vertical or horizontal), those are replaced by the next number. Additionally, any isolated 1 that's part of a cross-shaped structure (like in the lower part of Example 0's input) might also be replaced. But how to define that structure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement happens to 1s that are adjacent to other numbers. For example, in Example 0's row 7, the single 1 is adjacent to 0s, but it's replaced. In Example 2's row 10, the single 1 is not replaced, but it's surrounded by 0s. So that doesn't explain.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the position of the 1s relative to other numbers. In Example 0, the 1s are in the lower part, perhaps in regions that are enclosed by 5s. But how does that determine replacement?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on layers. For example, the 1s in the outermost layer are replaced by a certain number, but inner layers remain. But this seems too vague.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 1s that are replaced are in positions that are not adjacent to 5s. The 5s form a border. The 1s are inside or outside? Let me check.\n\nRow 1 of Example 0's input: [5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 5s are at positions 0 and 6. The 1s are at positions 13-15. So they are outside the 5s. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the pattern is that any 1s that form a cross (three in a row) are replaced by the number that forms a cross elsewhere in the input. For example, in Example 0, there are 2s forming a cross, so the 1s in a cross become 2s. In Example 1, there are 3s in a block, and 1s in a cross become 3s. In Example 2, 2s are present, so 1s in a cross become 2s. In Example 3, 3s are present, so 1s become 3s.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: any 1s that form a cross (three in a row, either vertical or horizontal) are replaced by the number that forms a cross or other structure in the input. But how to determine which number to use.\n\nAlternatively, the number to replace with is the maximum number present in the input. Let's see:\n\nExample 0: max is 5. But 1s become 2.\n\nExample 1: max is 5, but 1s become 3.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the next higher number than the number surrounding the 1s. For example, in Example 0's 1s are near 0s, so next higher is 1, but that's not the case. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input. The test input has a lot of 2s in the lower part. The 1s in the upper part (rows 2 and 3) form horizontal lines. The 1s in rows 9-11 form a cross-shaped structure. According to the pattern, these should be replaced by 2s. Let's compare with the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 1s in a horizontal line are replaced by 2s. In Example 2's input, the 1s in a horizontal line are replaced by 2s. So in the test input, the same should happen. So all horizontal or vertical lines of three 1s become 2s. But also, single 1s that are part of a larger structure.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, even single 1s are replaced. So perhaps any 1, regardless of its position, is replaced by the next higher number present in the input. But then why in Example 2's input, the single 1 wasn't replaced. That's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is done only to 1s that are part of a group of three or more, either in a line or in a cross. So individual 1s are left as is. For instance, in Example 0's input, the single 1 in row 7 is part of a cross (maybe not). Wait, in Example 0's input row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. That's a single 1. In the output, it's replaced by 2. So that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the changes are:\n\n- All 1s become 2s.\n\nExample 1's output:\n\n- All 1s become 3s.\n\nExample 2's output:\n\n- Some 1s become 2s. The single 1 in row 10 remains.\n\nWait, no. In Example 2's input, the 1s in rows 11 and 12 are [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which are three 1s in a horizontal line. In the output, these become 2s.\n\nBut the single 1 in row 10 is not part of a group of three. So the pattern might be that any group of three or more consecutive 1s (horizontally or vertically) are replaced by the next higher number present in the input.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the single 1 in row 7 is part of a vertical line with the 1s in rows 7,8,9? Let me check:\n\nExample 0's input row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 1s in rows 7,8,9 form a vertical line (columns 10,11,12). So three in a vertical line. Thus, in the output, they become 2s. Similarly, the single 1 in row 15 is part of a vertical line with rows 15,16,17:\n\nRow 15: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 17: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 18: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the vertical line of 1s in rows 16,17,18 (columns 14,15,14, etc.). So that's a vertical line of three, hence replaced by 2s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: any group of three or more consecutive 1s in a straight line (vertical or horizontal) are replaced by the next higher number present in the input. If there's no higher number, perhaps not replaced, but in the examples, there's always a higher number.\n\nSo in the test input, we need to look for groups of three or more 1s in a straight line and replace them with 2s.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,0,2,2,2,0,0] \u2192 three 1s horizontally. So replaced by 2.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 three 1s. Replaced by 2.\n\nRow 9: [0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 four 1s horizontally (columns 6-9). So part of this line is replaced.\n\nRow 10: [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0] \u2192 three 1s horizontally at the start (columns 1-3), and four in columns 6-9, and three at the end (columns 14-16).\n\nRow 11: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 two 1s in columns 6-7 and a single in column 14. Not three in a row.\n\nSo in row 10, the three 1s at the start (columns 1-3) form a horizontal line, so replaced by 2. The four 1s in columns 6-9 would have at least three consecutive, so replaced by 2. The three at the end (14-16) also replaced by 2.\n\nBut according to the pattern, any three or more in a line are replaced. So in the test input:\n\nRow 2: three 1s \u2192 2s.\n\nRow 3: three 1s \u2192 2s.\n\nRow 6: four 1s \u2192 replaced (but they are in a row of four, so all become 2s).\n\nRow 9: four 1s in columns 6-9 \u2192 replaced by 2s.\n\nRow 10: three 1s at start \u2192 2s; four in middle \u2192 2s; three at end \u2192 2s.\n\nRow 11: two 1s \u2192 no change.\n\nRow 16: [0,2,2,2,2,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,2,2,0,5,0] \u2192 but this is a 2s structure, no 1s here.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input, the output should have all instances of three or more consecutive 1s (horizontally or vertically) replaced by 2s. Individual 1s or pairs remain as 1.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's input, the single 1 in row 7 is part of a vertical line with two other 1s. For example, if in rows 7,8,9 there's a vertical line. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo in column 11 of rows 7-9, there's a vertical line of three 1s. So those are replaced by 2s. Similarly, the single 1 in row 7's column 11 is part of a vertical line. So the rule is that any group of three 1s in a line (vertical or horizontal) are replaced. But then in the test input's row 4, there's a single 1 (row 4, column 3). That 1 is not part of a group of three, so it remains 1.\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input, only the groups of three or more consecutive 1s are replaced by 2s. Other 1s stay as 1.\n\nBut let's verify this with Example 2. In Example 2's input, there's a single 1 in row 10, which is not part of a group, so it remains. The three 1s in row 11's columns 10-12 are replaced by 2s.\n\nYes, that fits. So the pattern is: replace every occurrence of three or more consecutive 1s in a straight line (horizontal or vertical) with the next higher number present in the input. For the test input, that would be 2.\n\nSo now, applying this to the test input:\n\nIn row 2: three 1s \u2192 2,2,2.\n\nRow 3: three 1s \u2192 2,2,2.\n\nRow 6: four 1s \u2192 replaced by 2,2,2,2.\n\nRow 9: four 1s in columns 6-9 \u2192 2,2,2,2.\n\nRow 10: three 1s at start \u2192 2,2,2; four in middle \u2192 2,2,2,2; three at end \u2192 2,2,2.\n\nOther 1s, like in row 4 (single), row 9 (column 14), row 10 (column 14,15,16), etc., which are part of groups of three, get replaced. But individual 1s remain.\n\nWait, row 10's end part in test input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo three 1s here \u2192 replaced by 2s.\n\nBut in the test input's row 10: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the first three 1s (columns 1-3) become 2s. The four in columns 6-9 become 2s. The three in 14-16 become 2s.\n\nSimilarly, row 9's 1,1,1,1 (columns 6-9) become 2,2,2,2.\n\nRow 6: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 four 1s \u2192 all become 2s.\n\nOther 1s, like in row 4, row 9's column 14 (single 1), row 10's column 14 (part of three), etc.\n\nSo the final output should have all groups of three or more consecutive 1s (horizontally or vertically) replaced by 2s, and the rest remaining as 1s.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no 1s. No change.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,2,2,2,0,0] \u2192 no 1s. No change.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,0,2,2,2,0,0] \u2192 three 1s \u2192 2,2,2.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 three 1s \u2192 2,2,2.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 single 1 \u2192 remains 1.\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5] \u2192 single 1 \u2192 remains 1.\n\nRow 6: [0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 four 1s \u2192 2,2,2,2.\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 single 1 \u2192 remains 1.\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 two 1s \u2192 no change.\n\nRow 9: [0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 four 1s (columns 6-9) \u2192 2,2,2,2. The single 1 in column 14 remains.\n\nRow 10: [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0] \u2192 three 1s (columns 1-3) \u2192 2,2,2. four in columns 6-9 \u2192 2,2,2,2. three in columns 14-16 \u2192 2,2,2.\n\nRow 11: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 two 1s (columns 6-7) and single \u2192 no change.\n\nRow 12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no change.\n\nRows 13-19: these are part of the lower structure with 5s and 2s. The 1s here are in row 9, etc. But in the lower part, there are no 1s. So those remain as per the input.\n\nSo applying this, the test output should have all consecutive three or more 1s replaced by 2s. Let's format the output accordingly.",
