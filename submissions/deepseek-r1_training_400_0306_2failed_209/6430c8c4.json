        "cot_1": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput has 9 rows. Output has 4 rows. So maybe the input is split into two parts? Let's check the other examples. Yes, all inputs have 9 rows and outputs 4. Hmm. Maybe the first 4 rows of the input are processed in some way, then the next ones? Wait, let me count. The input for Example 0 has 9 rows, the output 4. So perhaps each output row is derived from combining or processing two input rows? Or maybe grouping the input into sections.\n\nWait, the fifth row in the input examples is always [4,4,4,4]. For example, in Example 0: [4,4,4,4] is the fifth input row. Then the next four rows are maybe something else. So the input structure might be: first four rows (0-3), then a row of 4s (4th row), then four more rows (5-8). Then the output is four rows. So maybe the output is combining the first four rows and the next four rows after the 4s row?\n\nBut how? Let's see. Let's take Example 0's input:\n\nFirst four rows:\n[7,7,0,7]\n[0,7,7,0]\n[0,7,7,7]\n[0,7,7,0]\n\nThen the 4s row, then rows 5-8:\n[4,4,4,4]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,2]\n[2,2,2,0]\n[2,0,0,2]\n\nWait, but after the 4s row, there are four more rows? Example 0's input after row 4 (index 4) is rows 5 to 8 (indices 5,6,7,8), which are four rows. Wait, no: rows 5,6,7,8 would be four rows (since starting from 0). Wait, the input in Example 0 is 9 rows. So rows 0-3 (first four), row 4 (4s), then rows 5-8 (four rows). Then the output is four rows. So maybe each output row is a combination of one row from the first group (0-3) and one from the second group (5-8). Or some other operation.\n\nLooking at the outputs. Let's take Example 0's output:\n\nOutput rows:\n[0,0,3,0]\n[3,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm. The 3s are in positions where perhaps a certain condition is met. Let's compare with the input rows.\n\nWait, maybe the 4s row is a separator. The first four rows (0-3) are maybe part of one structure, and the next four (5-8) another. But how to get the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the result of some operation between the first four rows and the next four rows. For example, adding their elements, but modulo something. But let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's output first row [0,0,3,0]. Let's see the input rows. For row 0 of the output, maybe combining row 0 and row 5. Row0 input: [7,7,0,7], row5: [0,0,0,0]. If we add them, 7+0=7, etc. That doesn't lead to 0,0,3,0. So maybe not addition.\n\nAlternatively, looking for positions where a 7 in the first group and a 2 in the second group align, leading to a 3. Let's see. Let's take the first output row of Example 0: [0,0,3,0]. The third element is 3. Let's check the first group's row 0 (input row 0) third element is 0. Hmm. Maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe each output row corresponds to two input rows: one from the first group (0-3) and one from the second group (5-8). For example, output row 0 could be combining row 0 and row 5. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow0 of first group: [7,7,0,7]\nRow5 of second group: [0,0,0,0]\nOutput row0: [0,0,3,0]\n\nHmm. How could 7 and 0 combine to 0? Or perhaps when a 7 and 2 are present in the same position?\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the 3 appears in the third position of the first row. Let's check the input rows. First group's row0 third element is 0. Second group's row5 third element is 0. Hmm, that's not helpful. Maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is created by checking where in the input rows (from first four and next four) there are 7s and 2s, and summing their counts in some way, then placing 3 where they overlap. Let's see.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 0: first row [0,0,3,0]. Let's check the corresponding positions in the first four rows and the next four.\n\nWait, maybe each output row is a combination of a row from the first four (0-3) and a row from the next four (5-8). For instance, output row 0 is first group row0 and second group row5.\n\nFirst group row0: [7,7,0,7]\nSecond group row5: [0,0,0,0]\nIf 7 and 0 are present in the same position, maybe sum 7+0=7, but how to get 3?\n\nAlternatively, the presence of 7 in the first group and 2 in the second group could result in 3. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's output, first row has a 3 in position 2. Let's check first group row0 position 2 is 0, second group row5 position2 is 0. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about 4x4 grids. The output has four rows, each with four elements. The input's first four rows (0-3) could be arranged as a 4x4 grid, and the next four rows (5-8) as another. Then the output is some operation between these two grids.\n\nWait, but the input's first four rows are each 4 elements. So they form a 4x4 grid. Similarly, rows 5-8 are four rows, each 4 elements. The output is also four rows of four elements. So maybe the output is generated by combining these two grids in some way.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input first four rows (0-3):\n\nRow0: 7,7,0,7\n\nRow1:0,7,7,0\n\nRow2:0,7,7,7\n\nRow3:0,7,7,0\n\nRows 5-8 (second group):\n\nRow5:0,0,0,0\n\nRow6:0,2,0,2\n\nRow7:2,2,2,0\n\nRow8:2,0,0,2\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Let's take each position in the output and see if the corresponding positions in the first group and second group have certain values.\n\nFor example, the output's first row, third element is 3. Let's check in the first group's first row, third element is 0. Second group's first row (row5) third element is 0. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 appears where a 7 is in the first group and a 2 in the second group. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first 3 is in position (0,2). Wait, first group's row0, position2 is 0. Second group's row5, position2 is 0. No 7 or 2 there.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is counting the number of times 7 and 2 appear in the same position across the two groups. But then why the maximum output is 3? Or perhaps the sum of 7 and 2 is 9, but mod 6 gives 3. Because 7+2=9, 9 mod 6 is 3. That could make sense. Let me check that.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's output, where is there a 3? Let's look for positions where first group has 7 and second group has 2. Let's take output row0, position2 is 3. Let's check first group row0, position2 is 0. Second group row5, position2 is 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the 3 is when the sum of the corresponding elements in the two grids is 7+2=9, which mod 6 is 3. Let's test this.\n\nTake Example 0's output row0: [0,0,3,0].\n\nFirst group row0 (7,7,0,7) and second group row5 (0,0,0,0). The sum would be 7+0=7, 7+0=7, 0+0=0, 7+0=7. Then mod6 of these would be 1,1,0,1. But the output here is 0,0,3,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 is when the first group has 7 and the second group has 2 in the same position, then the sum is 7+2=9 mod6=3. Let's check other positions.\n\nTake Example 0's output row1: [3,0,0,0]. So position (1,0) is 3.\n\nFirst group row1 is [0,7,7,0]. Second group row6 is [0,2,0,2].\n\nFor row1 in first group (row index1) and row6 in second group (row index1 of the second group, since second group is rows5-8, which are four rows). So output row1 would correspond to first group row1 and second group row6.\n\nFirst group row1: [0,7,7,0]\n\nSecond group row6: [0,2,0,2]\n\nSumming each position:\n\n0+0=0 \u2192 0 mod6 is 0.\n\n7+2=9 \u2192 mod6=3.\n\n7+0=7 \u2192 mod6=1.\n\n0+2=2 \u2192 mod6=2.\n\nSo the output would be [0,3,1,2], but the actual output is [3,0,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's look at the first group (rows0-3) and the second group (rows5-8), and the output seems to have 3s where certain conditions are met. Let's check where 3s appear in the outputs and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example0's output, the first row has a 3 at position2. Let's check all the input rows. Wait, maybe it's looking for a 7 in the first group and a 2 in the second group in the same column but different rows. Or maybe columns across the groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell is the count of how many times a 7 in the first group and a 2 in the second group appear in the same column. For example, in column0:\n\nLooking at first group's column0: rows0-3 have 7,0,0,0. So 7 appears once.\n\nSecond group's column0: rows5-8 have 0,0,2,2. So 2s appear twice.\n\nSo 1 occurrence in first group's column0 (7) and two in second group's column0 (2s). The product is 1*2=2, but the output's column0 in Example0 is:\n\nRow0 of output has 0 in column0.\n\nRow1 has 3 in column0.\n\nRow2 and 3 have 0.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, check the positions where there's a 7 in the first group and a 2 in the second group in the same column. Then sum for each column.\n\nBut how does that lead to the output rows?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a 4x4 grid where each cell (i,j) represents the sum of the number of 7s in the j-th column of the first group's i-th row and the number of 2s in the j-th column of the second group's i-th row. Wait, maybe not. Let's take Example0.\n\nFirst group is rows0-3:\n\nRow0: [7,7,0,7] (column0:7, column1:7, column2:0, column3:7)\n\nRow1: [0,7,7,0]\n\nRow2: [0,7,7,7]\n\nRow3: [0,7,7,0]\n\nSecond group is rows5-8:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,2,0,2]\n\nRow7: [2,2,2,0]\n\nRow8: [2,0,0,2]\n\nSo for output cell (i,j), maybe count the number of 7s in column j of the first group and 2s in column j of the second group. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each position (i,j) in the output, check how many 7s are in the first group's column j, and how many 2s are in the second group's column j. Multiply those counts and take modulo something. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0's first group columns:\n\nColumn0: 7 (row0), 0 (row1), 0 (row2), 0 (row3). So count of 7s is 1.\n\nSecond group columns:\n\nColumn0 in second group (rows5-8): 0,0,2,2 \u2192 count of 2s is 2.\n\n1 * 2 = 2. So maybe output for column0 is 2. But in Example0's output, column0 has 0,3,0,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 3s are where in the same position (i,j) across the first and second groups, a 7 and a 2 are present. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0, output's first row is [0,0,3,0]. Let's check first group's row0 and second group's row5 (since output rows may correspond to row pairs).\n\nFirst group row0: [7,7,0,7]\n\nSecond group row5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nNo 7s and 2s in the same positions here. So no 3s. But the output has a 3 in position2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of how many times a 7 in the first group's row and a 2 in the second group's row are in the same position. Let's see.\n\nTake Example0's output row0: which corresponds to first group row0 and second group row5. So comparing [7,7,0,7] and [0,0,0,0]. There are no positions where 7 and 2 are present. So why the output row0 has a 3? This approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: The 4s row (row4) might be a separator, and perhaps the output is a combination of the first four rows and the next four rows (rows5-8), but maybe the 4s row is a clue for how to combine them. For example, perhaps the 4s indicate that the output is a sum of the first four and the next four rows, but with 4s being a modulus. For example, sum each element and take modulo 4+something. Wait, the 4s row is all 4s. Maybe each element is (sum from first group + sum from second group) mod 4+ something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by looking at each column across the first four rows and the next four rows. For example, in each column, if there's a 7 in the first group and a 2 in the second group, then output a 3 there. Let's check.\n\nTake Example0's output column2 of first row. The first group's row0, column2 is 0. Second group's row5, column2 is 0. No 3 here, but the output is 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each output row is derived from a specific pair of input rows. For example, output row0 is row0 and row5, row1 is row1 and row6, etc.\n\nLet's take Example0's output row0: [0,0,3,0]. Let's look at row0 and row5.\n\nRow0: [7,7,0,7]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nIf we have a 7 in row0 and a 0 in row5, maybe that's not contributing. But how to get 3 here. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the two rows, but 7+0=7, which mod4 would be 3 (since 4 is the separator row). Wait, the fifth row is all 4s. Maybe the modulus is 4. So 7 mod4 is 3. So for each element in the first group (rows0-3), take element mod4, and for the second group (rows5-8), take element mod4. Then sum them.\n\nSo for Example0's row0 (7,7,0,7) mod4 is (3,3,0,3). Row5 (0,0,0,0) mod4 is (0,0,0,0). Summing element-wise: 3+0=3, 3+0=3, 0+0=0, 3+0=3. So output row0 would be [3,3,0,3]. But the actual output is [0,0,3,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the product of elements from the first group and second group, mod something. For example, 7*0=0 mod6=0. 7*0=0, etc. But that doesn't lead to 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 3 where the first group has a 7 and the second group has a 2. Let's check for Example0.\n\nLooking at the first group's row0: [7,7,0,7]\n\nSecond group's row5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nNo 2s here. So output row0 would be [0,0,0,0], which doesn't match the example's [0,0,3,0].\n\nBut Example0's output row0 has a 3 in position2. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is a 4x4 grid where each cell counts the number of times a 7 appears in the corresponding column of the first group and a 2 appears in the corresponding column of the second group. Then multiply those counts and take mod4 or something.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nFirst group columns:\n\nColumn0: 7,0,0,0 \u2192 count of 7s: 1\n\nColumn1:7,7,7,7 \u2192 count of 7s:4\n\nColumn2:0,7,7,7 \u2192 count of 7s:3\n\nColumn3:7,0,7,0 \u2192 count of 7s:2\n\nSecond group columns (rows5-8):\n\nColumn0:0,0,2,2 \u2192 count of 2s:2\n\nColumn1:0,2,2,0 \u2192 count of 2s:2\n\nColumn2:0,0,2,0 \u2192 count of 2s:1\n\nColumn3:0,2,0,2 \u2192 count of 2s:2\n\nSo for each output cell (i,j) maybe it's (count7_in_first_group_colj * count2_in_second_group_colj) mod4.\n\nFor column0: 1*2=2 mod4=2. But Example0's output columns0 are [0,3,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the sum of the counts, but in the training examples, the maximum output is 3. For example, count7_in_first_group_colj + count2_in_second_group_colj, then mod4.\n\nBut let's see. Column0 in first group has 1, column0 in second group has 2. Sum is 3 \u2192 3 mod4=3. But in Example0's output, column0 in the first row is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each output row corresponds to a certain operation between two rows from the input, but not sure which. Let's look at the number of 3s in the outputs. For Example0, there are two 3s. In Example1, there are four 3s. In Example2, five 3s. Example3, four 3s. So the 3s are appearing in varying numbers. Perhaps the 3s are generated when certain conditions are met in the input rows.\n\nWait, looking at the first group and the second group:\n\nFirst group has numbers 7 and 0s. Second group has 2s and 0s, and 4s. The output has 3s. Maybe 3 is 7 - 4 (since the separator row is all 4s), and 2 is 4 - 2. So 7-4=3, 4-2=2. But how does this relate to the output.\n\nAlternatively, 7+2=9, which mod6 is 3. But why mod6? Not sure. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's output row1, column0 is 3. Let's check first group row1, column0 is 0. Second group row6, column0 is 0. So 0+0=0. Not 3.\n\nHmm. Another angle: The output rows are 4x4, which might suggest that each output row is a combination of two input rows. For example, each output row is formed by combining two input rows (maybe from different groups) in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [0,0,3,0]\n\nRow1: [3,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 3s are in the first two rows. Let's check input rows. Maybe the first output row is row0 of first group and row5 of second group. Second output row is row1 and row6. Third row is row2 and row7. Fourth row is row3 and row8.\n\nLet's check for 7s and 2s in the same position in these pairs.\n\nExample0:\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,3,0]. This would correspond to first group row0 and second group row5.\n\nRow0 of first group: [7,7,0,7]\n\nRow5 of second group: [0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for positions where first has 7 and second has 2. But row5 has all 0s. So no matches. So why a 3 in position2?\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: The 3s are where in the same column, the first group has a 7 and the second group has a 2. Let's check columns.\n\nExample0's output has a 3 in row0, column2. Let's look at column2:\n\nFirst group column2: row0 is 0, row1 is7, row2 is7, row3 is7.\n\nSecond group column2: row5 is0, row6 is0, row7 is2, row8 is0.\n\nSo in column2 of the first group, there are 3 7s (rows1,2,3). In column2 of the second group, there's one 2 (row7). So 3*1=3. Which might explain the 3 in the output. But how does this relate to the output rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is the number of times a 7 appears in row i of the first group and a 2 appears in row i of the second group, at column j. Wait, let's check.\n\nExample0's output row0, column2 is 3. So row0 of first group is [7,7,0,7], row5 of second group is [0,0,0,0]. Looking at column2, first group has 0, second group has 0. So no 7 and 2. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is generated by overlapping the first four rows and the next four rows (second group), and for each position, if there's a 7 in the first group and a 2 in the second group, then output 3. Otherwise 0. But how to determine which rows to overlap.\n\nBut Example0's output has a 3 in row1, column0. Let's check first group row1, column0: 0. Second group row6, column0:0. So no 7 and 2. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach. Let's look at the test input and see if there's a pattern that can be applied once we know the rule.\n\nTest input:\n\n[7,7,7,7]\n\n[0,7,7,7]\n\n[7,0,0,0]\n\n[7,0,7,0]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[0,2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\nThe output should be four rows. Following the previous examples' structure, the first four rows are the first group (0-3), then the 4s row (4), then the next four rows (5-8).\n\nSo first group:\n\nRow0:7,7,7,7\n\nRow1:0,7,7,7\n\nRow2:7,0,0,0\n\nRow3:7,0,7,0\n\nSecond group:\n\nRow5:0,2,2,2\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0\n\nRow7:2,0,2,2\n\nRow8:0,2,0,0\n\nLooking at the output examples, the 3s are placed where certain conditions are met. Let's assume that in the output, each 3 corresponds to a position where there's a 7 in the first group and a 2 in the second group in the same column, but in possibly different rows. For example, in the first group's column j, there are x 7s, and in the second group's column j, there are y 2s. The product x*y would give the number of 3s in column j of the output. But how would that distribute into the output rows?\n\nWait, but in Example0's output, column2 has a 3 in row0. How would that happen? Let's see:\n\nFirst group column2 has 0,7,7,7 (three 7s). Second group column2 has 0,0,2,0 (one 2). So 3*1=3. So maybe in column2, the output has three 3s. But in Example0's output, column2 has one 3. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell (i,j) is 3 if the first group's row i has a 7 in column j and the second group's row i has a 2 in column j. Otherwise 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0.\n\nFirst group row0: [7,7,0,7]\n\nSecond group row5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nSo for output row0: check each column. In column0: 7 and 0 \u2192 no. Columns1:7 and 0 \u2192 no. Column2:0 and0 \u2192 no. Column3:7 and0 \u2192 no. So output row0 should be [0,0,0,0], but actual is [0,0,3,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. What if the output row corresponds to the sum of 7s in the first group's row and 2s in the second group's row? For example, for output row0, sum the number of 7s in first group's row0 and 2s in second group's row5. But in Example0's first group row0 has three 7s, second group row5 has zero 2s. Sum is 3+0=3. But the output row0 is [0,0,3,0], which doesn't sum to 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell in the output is 3 if there's a 7 in the first group's row and a 2 in the corresponding second group's row, but in the same position (i,j). For example, output cell (i,j) is 3 if first_group[i][j] is 7 and second_group[i][j] is 2. Otherwise 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nOutput row0: first_group row0 (7,7,0,7) and second_group row5 (0,0,0,0). So no 7 and 2 pairs. So output row0 should be all 0s. But the actual output row0 is [0,0,3,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is created by vertically summing the columns of the first group and second group, then applying some operation. For example, sum each column in first group and second group, then for each column, if the sum is 7 from first group and 2 from second group, sum them to 9 mod6=3.\n\nLet's try for Example0:\n\nFirst group columns:\n\nColumn0:7,0,0,0 \u2192 sum=7\n\nColumn1:7,7,7,7 \u2192 sum=28\n\nColumn2:0,7,7,7 \u2192 sum=21\n\nColumn3:7,0,7,0 \u2192 sum=14\n\nSecond group columns:\n\nColumn0:0,0,2,2 \u2192 sum=4 (2+2)\n\nColumn1:0,2,2,0 \u2192 sum=4\n\nColumn2:0,0,2,0 \u2192 sum=2\n\nColumn3:0,2,0,2 \u2192 sum=4\n\nFor each column j:\n\nSum_first = sum of first group's column j.\n\nSum_second = sum of second group's column j.\n\nThen, (sum_first + sum_second) mod something. For example, 7+4=11 mod8=3. But Example0's output column0 in row0 has 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, sum_first mod4 and sum_second mod4, then multiply.\n\nFor Example0's column0:\n\nsum_first mod4:7 mod4=3\n\nsum_second mod4:4 mod4=0 \u2192 3*0=0 \u2192 which is the output column0's first row. But the output in column0 has 3 in row1. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the output is generated by checking for each position in the first group's rows (0-3) if there's a 7, and in the corresponding position in the second group's rows (5-8) if there's a 2. The number of overlapping 7 and 2 pairs in the same column but any rows.\n\nFor example, for column0 in the first group: there's one 7 (row0). In the second group's column0: two 2s (rows7 and8). So total pairs would be 1*2=2. So in the output's column0, there would be two 3s. But in Example0's output, column0 has one 3. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows correspond to the rows of the first group, and for each cell in the output row, it's 3 if the corresponding row in the first group has a 7 and the corresponding row in the second group has a 2 in the same position. Otherwise 0.\n\nFor Example0's output row0: first group row0 and second group row5. Check positions:\n\n7 and0 \u2192 no.\n\n7 and0 \u2192 no.\n\n0 and0 \u2192 no.\n\n7 and0 \u2192 no. So output row0 would be all 0s. But actual output row0 has a 3 in position2. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a matrix where each element is 3 if the sum of the corresponding elements in the first group and second group is 9 (7+2). Otherwise, 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0's output.\n\nFirst group row0: [7,7,0,7]\n\nSecond group row5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nSumming each position:\n\n7+0=7 \u2192 no.\n\n7+0=7 \u2192 no.\n\n0+0=0 \u2192 no.\n\n7+0=7 \u2192 no. So output row0 would be all 0s. But the actual output row0 has a 3 in position2. So this is not correct.\n\nWhat if the sum is 7+2=9, but in different rows. For example, if in any row of the first group and any row of the second group, the same position has 7 and 2, then the output position gets 3. But how to map that to four output rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output counts the number of times a 7 in the first group's column and a 2 in the second group's column appear in the same column across all rows. For example, in column0 of first group, there's one 7 (row0), and in column0 of second group, two 2s (rows7,8). So 1*2=2. So output column0 would have 2 3s. But how to arrange them in the output.\n\nThis seems too vague. Let's look at another training example. Let's take Example1:\n\nInput:\n\nFirst group rows0-3:\n\n[0,0,7,7]\n\n[0,0,7,7]\n\n[0,7,7,0]\n\n[7,7,0,0]\n\nSecond group rows5-8:\n\n[2,0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,3]\n\nLooking at output row0: [0,3,0,0]. Let's see if this corresponds to first group row0 and second group row5.\n\nFirst group row0: [0,0,7,7]\n\nSecond group row5: [2,0,2,0]\n\nSo checking for 7 and 2 in the same positions:\n\nPosition0:0 and2 \u2192 no.\n\nPosition1:0 and0 \u2192 no.\n\nPosition2:7 and2 \u2192 yes.\n\nPosition3:7 and0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo output row0 position2 would be 3, but the actual output is [0,3,0,0]. The 3 is in position1. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by some rotation or transposition of the input rows. For example, the first group is rotated and then combined with the second group in some way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the result of a bitwise operation between the first and second group, treating 7 and 2 as binary numbers. But 7 is 111 in binary, 2 is 010. Their XOR is 101 which is 5. Not related to 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 is the result of 7 divided by 2, but 7/2 is 3.5, so maybe floor to 3. But how does that apply.\n\nIf in a position there's a 7 in the first group and a 2 in the second group, then output 3. Otherwise, 0.\n\nLet's check Example1's output row0: [0,3,0,0]. So in position1, there's a 3. First group row0 position1 is 0. Second group row5 position1 is 0. So no. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a pattern in all examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nExample0's output has 3s in positions (0,2), (1,0).\n\nExample1's output has 3s in (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,3), (3,3).\n\nExample2's output has 3s in (0,0), (0,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0).\n\nExample3's output has 3s in (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,2).\n\nLooking for a pattern where 3s are placed in certain positions. Maybe each 3 in the output corresponds to a 7 in the first group's row and a 2 in the second group's row, but not necessarily the same row.\n\nFor example, if in column j of the first group, there's a 7 in row i, and in the second group's column j, there's a 2 in row k. Then the output cell (i, j) is 3.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to pair. Or perhaps the output is a matrix where each cell (i,j) is 3 if the first group's row i has a 7 in column j and the second group's row i has a 2 in column j. Let's test this for Example1.\n\nExample1's output row0 is [0,3,0,0]. So cell (0,1) is 3.\n\nFirst group row0, column1 is 0. Second group row5, column1 is 0. So no. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each column j, if there's a 7 in any row of the first group's column j and a 2 in any row of the second group's column j, then all cells in column j of the output are 3. But Example0's output has column2 with a 3 in row0, but other rows in column2 are 0. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider that the output is a result of the first group's rows being transformed into the output by the second group's rows. For example, the second group's rows represent directions or shifts. For example, if a row in the second group has a 2, it might indicate a shift or a merge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output is the result of merging the corresponding row in the first group and the corresponding row in the second group. For example, output row0 is first group row0 merged with second group row5, etc. Let's see:\n\nExample0's output row0: [0,0,3,0]\n\nFirst group row0: [7,7,0,7]\n\nSecond group row5: [0,0,0,0]\n\nMerging: perhaps where first group has 7 and second group has 0, you get 0. Where both have 7 and 0, but that's not clear. But how to get 3 in position2.\n\nAlternatively, adding the values: 7+0=7. Then 7 mod4=3. The separator row is 4, so maybe mod4. So 7 mod4=3. So for each element in the first group, mod4 gives 3 for 7. So first group's row0 mod4 would be [3,3,0,3]. Second group's row5 is [0,0,0,0]. Adding them would give [3,3,0,3]. But the output is [0,0,3,0]. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if the first group's elements are replaced by 3 when they are 7, and the second group's elements are replaced by 0 when they are 0, and added. But that doesn't explain the output.\n\nWait, let's think of each 7 in the first group as 3 mod4. So each 7 becomes 3. Then, the output is the sum of these transformed values and the second group's values mod4. For example, first group row0: [3,3,0,3]. Second group row5: [0,0,0,0]. Sum: [3,3,0,3] mod4 is [3,3,0,3]. But output row0 is [0,0,3,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the difference between the first group and the second group mod4. For Example0's row0: [7-0,7-0,0-0,7-0] = [7,7,0,7]. mod4 would be [3,3,0,3]. Again, not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is where the first group has 7 and the second group has 2, but in the same column. For each column, count the number of such pairs and place the count in the output. But how to distribute the counts across the output rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of 7s in the first group's column j multiplied by the number of 2s in the second group's column j, then placed in all rows of column j. But in Example0, column0 has 1*2=2, which would mean two 3s (since 2 mod4=2, but 3 is different). Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's try to look for another pattern. The output might involve looking at the positions where 7 and 2 are present in the same column across the first and second groups, then placing a 3 in the lowest possible row of that column. Or some other arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the result of some kind of collision or movement. For example, the 7s and 2s represent objects moving in certain directions and colliding, creating 3s where they meet. But this is vague.\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,3]\n\nThe 3s are in various positions. Maybe the first group's 7s are moving downward and the second group's 2s are moving upward, and where they meet, a 3 is placed. For example, if a 7 is in a higher row and a 2 is in a lower row in the same column, they collide in the middle rows.\n\nBut I'm not sure. For Example1's column0:\n\nFirst group column0 has 0,0,0,7.\n\nSecond group column0 has 2,0,0,0.\n\nSo the 7 is in row3 of first group, and 2 in row5 of second group. If they move towards each other, they might meet in row1 or row2 of the output. But Example1's output has 3 in row0, row1, row2, and row3 for various columns.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of each 3 in the output as a result of a 7 in the first group's row i, column j and a 2 in the second group's row (3 - i), column j. For example, mirroring the row indices. Let's check Example0.\n\nExample0's output row0 has a 3 in column2. First group row0, column2 is 0. Second group row3 (5+3=8?), but second group rows are 5-8. So row5 is index0 of second group. So for row0 of output, checking first group row0 and second group row0 (row5). Column2: 0 and 0. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, first group row i and second group row (3 - i). For output row0: i=0, second group row3 (row8). First group row0, column2 is 0. Second group row8, column2 is0. No.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe it's time to try to look for a pattern in the test input and see if we can generate the output based on previous examples.\n\nTest input's first group:\n\nRow0:7,7,7,7\n\nRow1:0,7,7,7\n\nRow2:7,0,0,0\n\nRow3:7,0,7,0\n\nSecond group:\n\nRow5:0,2,2,2\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0\n\nRow7:2,0,2,2\n\nRow8:0,2,0,0\n\nAssuming that the output is generated by placing a 3 wherever a 7 in the first group's row and a 2 in the second group's row exist in the same position. Let's check for each output row:\n\nOutput row0 would combine first group row0 and second group row5:\n\n7 and0 \u2192 no.\n\n7 and2 \u2192 yes (position1,2,3 of row5 are 2s, but first group row0 has 7s there. So positions1,2,3 of first group row0 are 7s. Second group row5 has 2s in those positions. So output row0 would have 3s in positions1,2,3. But according to previous examples, maybe there's a modulus or some other operation. But in Example0's output row0, the 3 is in position2, but according to this rule, there would be 3s in multiple positions. But the test input's first group row0 and second group row5 have 7 and 2 in positions1,2,3. So output row0 would be [0,3,3,3]. But looking at the training examples, when there are multiple overlaps, like in Example1's output row2 has [3,0,0,3], maybe it's not simply filling all positions where 7 and 2 meet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is the result of overlapping the first group's row and the second group's row, but only one 3 per row or column.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll make an educated guess based on some pattern I'm missing. Looking at the training examples, the outputs seem to have 3s where certain combinations of 7s and 2s are present. For the test input, let's consider the output rows as follows:\n\nFor each row in the first group (0-3), compare with the corresponding row in the second group (5-8). For each position where the first group has a 7 and the second group has a 2, put a 3. Otherwise 0.\n\nSo for test input:\n\nFirst group row0: [7,7,7,7]\n\nSecond group row5: [0,2,2,2]\n\nComparing each position:\n\n7 and0 \u2192 0.\n\n7 and2 \u2192 3.\n\n7 and2 \u2192 3.\n\n7 and2 \u2192 3.\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,3,3,3]. But looking at the training examples, like Example1's row0 has [0,3,0,0]. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the first occurrence in each column is considered. Or some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the sum of the first group mod4 and second group mod4. So 7 mod4 is3, 2 mod4 is2. 3+2=5 mod4=1. So output would be1, but in examples, the output is3. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Another Idea: Perhaps the output is the result of a bitwise AND between the first group and the second group, but in a certain way. For example, 7 is 111 in binary, 2 is 010. 111 AND 010 is 010, which is 2. Not 3. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 7 OR 2 is 7, which is 7 mod4=3. So maybe output is 3 wherever there's a 7 in the first group or a 2 in the second group. But Example0's output row0 has 3 in position2 where first group is0 and second group is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Given that in the test input's first group row0 has 7s in all positions, and second group row5 has 2s in positions1-3, maybe the output row0 will have 3s in those positions. But looking at the training examples, sometimes this doesn't result in multiple 3s. For example, in Example1's first group row0 has 7s in positions2 and3, and second group row5 has 2s in positions0 and2. But the output row0 has a 3 in position1, which doesn't align. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output counts the number of 7s in the first group's column and the number of 2s in the second group's column, then places 3s in the output's rows based on some criteria. For example, in the test input's column0:\n\nFirst group column0 has 7,0,7,7 \u2192 three 7s.\n\nSecond group column0 has 0,0,2,0 \u2192 one 2.\n\nSo 3*1=3. So column0 would have three 3s. But how to distribute them in the output's four rows. Maybe in the first three rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll hazard a guess that the output is generated by checking for each column j, the number of 7s in the first group's column j and the number of 2s in the second group's column j. The product of these counts modulo 4 is placed in the output's rows, possibly in a specific order.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nFirst group columns:\n\nColumn0:7,0,7,7 \u2192 count7=3.\n\nColumn1:7,7,0,0 \u2192 count7=2.\n\nColumn2:7,7,0,7 \u2192 count7=3.\n\nColumn3:7,7,0,0 \u2192 count7=2.\n\nSecond group columns:\n\nColumn0:0,0,2,0 \u2192 count2=1.\n\nColumn1:2,0,0,2 \u2192 count2=2.\n\nColumn2:2,0,2,0 \u2192 count2=2.\n\nColumn3:2,0,2,0 \u2192 count2=2.\n\nProduct for each column:\n\nColumn0:3*1=3 \u2192 3 mod4=3.\n\nColumn1:2*2=4 \u2192 mod4=0.\n\nColumn2:3*2=6 \u2192 mod4=2.\n\nColumn3:2*2=4 \u2192 mod4=0.\n\nBut how to distribute these values into the output rows. Perhaps each column's value is spread across the output rows. For example, column0's 3 could result in three 3s in column0 of the output. But how to arrange them.\n\nAlternatively, each output row's column j is the count of 7s in first group's column j multiplied by count of 2s in second group's column j, then take mod4. So for test input:\n\nColumn0:3*1=3 \u21923 mod4=3. So all rows in column0 would have 3. But this doesn't fit the training examples. Example0's column0 has output row1 as 3, others 0.\n\nHmm. This approach might not be correct.\n\nAfter struggling for so long, I'll have to guess that the output is generated by placing a 3 wherever there's a 7 in the first group and a 2 in the second group in the same column, regardless of the row. Then, the output rows are somehow arranged based on the positions of these matches. \n\nFor the test input:\n\nFirst group has 7s in columns0-3 for row0.\n\nSecond group row5 has 2s in columns1-3.\n\nSo column0: first group has 7 in row0, second group has 0 \u2192 no match.\n\nColumn1: 7 in row0, 2 in row5 \u2192 match. So 3 in column1.\n\nColumn2: 7 in row0, 2 in row5 \u2192 match. 3 in column2.\n\nColumn3: 7 in row0, 2 in row5 \u2192 match. 3 in column3.\n\nSo output row0 would have 3s in columns1,2,3. But in training examples, Example1's row0 has a 3 in column1. Maybe the output rows are filled based on the earliest occurrence in the columns. Or perhaps the number of matches determines how many 3s are in each column.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to guess the output for the test input based on some pattern I might have missed.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and output grids. The input seems to have multiple rows, but the output is a 4x4 grid each time. Let me look at the examples to see how the inputs are transformed into the outputs.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\nThere are 9 rows in the input. The first four rows are [7,7,0,7], [0,7,7,0], [0,7,7,7], [0,7,7,0], then rows 5-9 are different. The output is a 4x4 grid. Maybe the first four rows of the input are somehow involved, but how?\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the numbers are 0s and 3s. Let's see the input's first four rows. Hmm, perhaps the 7s are being transformed. Let's check the other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first four rows also have 7s and 0s. The output again has 3s where there were 7s. Wait, maybe the 7s in the input's first four rows are converted to 3s in some way, but not directly. Let's look for a pattern in their positions.\n\nFor instance, Example 0's first input row is [7,7,0,7]. The first row of the output is [0,0,3,0]. So the third position in the first input row (which is 0) becomes 3? That doesn't make sense. Or maybe the 7s in the input's first four rows correspond to 3s in the output, but the positions are shifted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of certain rows from the input. Let's check the input structure. The input has 9 rows each time. The first four rows, then the fifth row is all 4s, and the next four rows (6-9) have 2s and 0s. The outputs are 4x4, which is four rows. Maybe the output is combining elements from the first four rows (with 7s) and the next four rows (rows 6-9, which have 2s and 0s). But how?\n\nAnother thought: Maybe each output cell is determined by the sum of certain values from the input rows. Let's look at Example 0's output. The first output row is [0,0,3,0]. Let's see the corresponding input rows. The first input row is [7,7,0,7], the second is [0,7,7,0], third [0,7,7,7], fourth [0,7,7,0]. If we add up each column for these rows:\n\nFirst column: 7+0+0+0=7\nSecond column:7+7+7+7=28\nThird column:0+7+7+7=21\nFourth column:7+0+7+0=14\nBut the output doesn't seem to directly relate to these sums. Alternatively, maybe each 7 in the first four input rows contributes to the output, but only when there's a 2 in the corresponding position in the lower rows (rows 6-9). Wait, the fifth row is all 4s, maybe that's a separator. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the sixth row is [0,0,0,0], seventh [0,2,0,2], eighth [2,2,2,0], ninth [2,0,0,2]. Hmm, perhaps the 2s in these rows (rows 6-9) indicate where the 3s are placed in the output. Let me check.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the first row's third element is 3. In the input's rows 6-9, which rows have a 2 in the third column? The seventh row (third column 0), eighth row (third column 2), ninth row (third column 0). So for column 3, row 8 (third row of the 6-9 group) has a 2. Maybe that's where the 3 comes from. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is the count of 2s in the corresponding position in the lower four rows (rows 6-9), multiplied by 3? Wait, in Example 0's output, the first row has a 3 in the third position. Let's check the input rows 6-9 for third column. The sixth row third column is 0, seventh is 0, eighth is 2, ninth is 0. So only the eighth row (third row in the lower group) has a 2. So 2*3=6? No, that doesn't fit. But the output is 3 here. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps each 2 in the lower four rows (rows 6-9) contributes to the output in some way, and the 7s in the first four rows (rows 0-3) also play a role. Maybe a 3 is placed in the output where there's a 7 in the first four rows and a 2 in the lower four rows for that position. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's output, position (0,2) which is 3. Let's look at the input. For row 0, column 2: first four rows (row 0) has a 0. Wait, but the output's first row is [0,0,3,0]. So row 0 of the output corresponds to which part of the input? Maybe each output row is combining the first four input rows and the next four (rows 6-9). Or perhaps the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is 3 if there's a 7 in the first four input rows and a 2 in rows 6-9 for that position, but that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by combining the first four rows (rows 0-3) and the next four (rows 6-9), where a 7 and a 2 in the same position would result in a 3. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row has [0,0,3,0]. Let's check the first column of the input's first four rows and rows 6-9. For the third column (since output's third element is 3):\n\nFirst four rows (rows 0-3) in third column:\n\nRow0:0, Row1:7, Row2:7, Row3:7. So 7s in rows 1,2,3. Then in rows 6-9 (rows 6-9 are the sixth to ninth rows in the input), which are rows 6: [0,0,0,0], 7: [0,2,0,2], 8: [2,2,2,0], 9: [2,0,0,2]. For the third column in these rows: row6:0, row7:0, row8:2, row9:0. So the third column in rows 6-9 has a 2 in row8. Now, in the first four rows, rows 1,2,3 (of the input) have 7 in the third column. So perhaps when a 7 is present in the same column of the first four rows and a 2 is present in the same column of rows 6-9, then we place a 3 in the output. But how do the rows map? Because the output is 4x4, maybe each row of the output corresponds to a combination of a row from the first four and a row from the next four (rows 6-9). For example, output row 0 could be row0 (first four) and row6 (lower four), output row1 is row1 and row7, etc. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,3,0]. Let's see input row0 (from first four) is [7,7,0,7], and input row6 (from lower four) is [0,0,0,0]. Where do 3s appear? The third position. So in input row0, third column is 0 (so maybe not). Wait, but how does that relate. Alternatively, maybe for each position (i,j) in the output, it's 3 if in the first four input rows, the j-th column has a 7 in row i, and in the lower four rows (rows 6-9), the j-th column has a 2 in row i (of the lower four). But the lower four rows are rows 6-9, which are four rows. So for output row0, maybe checking row6 (since 6-9 are rows 0-3 of the lower four?), and for output row0, column j, check if in the first four input rows, row0, column j is 7, and in row6 (the first of the lower four), column j is 2. If so, then 3. Otherwise 0.\n\nWait, let's see. In Example 0's output, the third column of the first row is 3. For the first input row (row0), column3 is 7 (input row0 is [7,7,0,7], so column3 is 7). Then, in the lower four rows (rows6-9), row6 is [0,0,0,0], so column3 is 0. So that doesn't match. Hmm. Maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by counting the number of times a 2 appears in the lower four rows (rows6-9) for each column, and the presence of 7s in the first four rows. For example, if a column in the first four rows has at least one 7 and in the lower four rows has exactly one 2, then the output for that column is 3. But how would this map to rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each column of the output is determined by looking at the corresponding columns in the first four rows and the lower four rows. For example, if in a column of the first four rows, there's a 7 in any of those rows, and in the same column of the lower four rows (rows6-9), there's a 2 in any of those rows, then the output column has a 3. But this would result in 3s in all columns where both conditions are met. But looking at Example0's output, which has a 3 in the third column of the first row. Let's check column 2 (third position) in the input.\n\nFirst four rows (rows0-3) column2: row0=0, row1=7, row2=7, row3=7. So there are 7s in rows1-3. Lower four rows (rows6-9) column2: row6=0, row7=0, row8=2, row9=0. So there's a 2 in row8. So column2 in the output would have 3s in the positions corresponding to rows where 7s are in the first four rows and 2s in the lower four. But how does that translate to rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a row in the first four and a row in the lower four. For example, output row0 is first row (row0) of first four and first row (row6) of lower four. If in any position, both have 7 and 2, respectively, then 3 is placed. But in Example0's row0 and row6, row0 has 7s in positions 0,1,3, but row6 (input row6) has 0s everywhere. So no 3s. But the output row0 has a 3 in position2. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7s in the first four rows and the 2s in the lower four rows are summed in some way. Like, for each column, if there's a 7 in any of the first four rows and a 2 in any of the lower four rows, then the output column has a 3. But how to determine which row in the output? Maybe the output is the sum of the counts. For example, if in column j, there are m 7s in the first four rows and n 2s in the lower four, then the output would be 3*(m + n), but that seems not to fit. For example, in Example0's third column (j=2), first four rows have three 7s (rows1-3, column2), lower four rows have one 2 (row8, column2). So total 4, but the output has 3 in that column. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe each 2 in the lower four rows (rows6-9) contributes to a 3 in the output, but only if there's a 7 in the same position in the first four rows. Let's check Example0's output. The third column of the first output row is 3. Let's check input row0 (first four rows) column2: 0. Lower four rows (row6) column2: 0. So that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the position in the output is determined by the row and column of the 2 in the lower four rows. For example, each 2 in row i (of the lower four rows) and column j would result in a 3 in the output row i and column j, provided that there's a 7 in the same column j in the first four rows. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's input, the lower four rows (rows6-9) are:\n\n6: [0,0,0,0]\n\n7: [0,2,0,2]\n\n8: [2,2,2,0]\n\n9: [2,0,0,2]\n\nSo, for row7 (which is the second row of the lower four, since rows6-9 are considered as rows0-3 in the lower group), the 2s are in columns1 and 3. Now, check if in the first four rows, columns1 and 3 have any 7s. Let's see:\n\nFirst four rows (rows0-3):\n\nrow0: [7,7,0,7]\n\nrow1: [0,7,7,0]\n\nrow2: [0,7,7,7]\n\nrow3: [0,7,7,0]\n\nFor column1 (index1), all rows (0-3) have 7s. For column3 (index3), rows0 and2 have 7s, rows1 and3 have 0. So, in row7 of the lower four (which is input row7), the 2s are in columns1 and3. Since columns1 and3 in the first four have 7s, this would mean that the output row1 (since lower four row1 is input row7) columns1 and3 would be 3. But looking at Example0's output, the output is:\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, output row1 is [3,0,0,0]. So column0 of row1 is 3. But according to this hypothesis, row1 (from lower four row1) has 2s at columns1 and3. So why is the output row1's column0 3? That doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the fifth row in each input example. In all examples, the fifth row is [4,4,4,4]. Maybe this acts as a separator, indicating that the first four rows are one group, the next four (rows6-9) are another group, and the fifth row is the divider. So perhaps the output is generated by combining these two groups. For example, each cell in the output is 3 if there's a 7 in the first group (rows0-3) and a 2 in the second group (rows6-9) in the same position, but how the rows are mapped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell (i,j) is 3 if in the first four rows (rows0-3) at position (i,j) there's a 7 and in the corresponding cell (i,j) of rows6-9 (rows6-9) there's a 2. Otherwise, 0. Let's check this.\n\nTake Example0's input. Let's check output row0, column2 (which is 3). First group row0, column2: 0. Second group row0 (input row6), column2:0. So that would be 0. But output has 3 there. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell (i,j) is 3 if there's a 7 in column j of any of the first four rows and a 2 in column j of any of the next four rows (rows6-9). But then the output would have 3s in all columns where both 7 and 2 appear in that column. But in Example0's output, there's a 3 in column2 of row0 and row1. Wait, the output's columns would have 3s if any of the columns in first four have 7 and any in lower four have 2.\n\nIn Example0's input, column0:\n\nFirst four rows: row0 has7, rows1-3 have0. Lower four rows: rows6 has0, row7 has0, row8 has2, row9 has2. So column0 has 7 in first group and 2 in lower group. So output column0 would have 3s. Looking at Example0's output, column0 has 3 in row1 and row0? The output's first row (row0) is [0,0,3,0], column0 is 0. Hmm, no. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the outputs and see if they can be derived from combining certain rows. For example, in Example0's output, the first row has a 3 in position2. The input rows0-3 have 7s in column2 in rows1,2,3. The input rows6-9 have a 2 in column2 in row8 (input row8). So maybe the output is combining the rows where there's a 2 in the lower group, and for those positions, if there's a 7 in the same column in the first group, then output a 3. So each 2 in the lower group's row i, column j contributes a 3 to the output's row (i) and column j, provided that in the first group's row i, column j there's a 7. Let's check.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nLower group rows (rows6-9):\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,2,0,2]\n\nRow8: [2,2,2,0]\n\nRow9: [2,0,0,2]\n\nSo, for row7 (lower group row1), column1 and 3 have 2s. Check first group row1 (input row1) columns1 and3: input row1 is [0,7,7,0]. So column1 is 7, column3 is 0. So for lower row1, column1 (2) and first group row1, column1 (7): this would mean output row1, column1 is 3. But in Example0's output row1 is [3,0,0,0]. So column0 is 3. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the same column across all rows. For example, a 2 in column j of any row in the lower group (rows6-9) and a 7 in column j of any row in the first group (rows0-3) results in a 3 in all positions of column j in the output. But Example0's output has 3 in column2 of row0. So column2 in first group has 7s in rows1,2,3, and column2 in lower group has a 2 in row8. So column2 would have 3s in all output rows' column2. But Example0's output has only one 3 in column2 (row0). So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output grids, the numbers are always 0 or 3. So perhaps 3 is the only non-zero value, and it's derived from some condition involving 7s and 2s.\n\nAnother idea: The first four rows of the input (rows0-3) and the next four rows (rows6-9) each form a 4x4 grid, but maybe the fifth row is a separator. Then the output is some interaction between these two 4x4 grids. For example, where the first grid has a 7 and the second grid has a 2 in the same position, the output is 3; otherwise 0. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nFirst four rows (rows0-3) form a 4x4 grid:\n\nRow0: [7,7,0,7]\n\nRow1: [0,7,7,0]\n\nRow2: [0,7,7,7]\n\nRow3: [0,7,7,0]\n\nNext four rows (rows6-9):\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,2,0,2]\n\nRow8: [2,2,2,0]\n\nRow9: [2,0,0,2]\n\nComparing these two grids. For each position (i,j), if first grid[i][j] is 7 and second grid[i][j] is 2, then output[i][j] is 3.\n\nLooking at position (1,1) in Example0's first grid is 7, and second grid row1, column1 is 2 (row7 is row1 of the lower grid). So output[1][1] should be 3. But Example0's output row1 is [3,0,0,0], so column0 is 3, but column1 is 0. That doesn't fit. So this can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the first grid and second grid, replacing 7+2 with 3, but others to 0. For example, 7+2=9, but the output uses 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 7 in the first grid and each 2 in the second grid, regardless of their positions, contribute to the output in some way. For instance, the number of 3s in the output is equal to the number of 7s in the first grid plus the number of 2s in the second grid divided by something, but this seems vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output, there are four 3s. The first grid has 12 7s (count them: row0: 3, row1: 2, row2:3, row3:2 \u2192 total 3+2+3+2=10). The second grid (rows6-9) has 5 2s. So 10 and 5. Doesn't directly relate to 4.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the output's 3s as being the positions where in the same row and column, there's a 7 in the first group and a 2 in the second group. But how the rows are aligned. For example, output row i is the combination of first group row i and second group row i. For each cell (i,j), if first[i][j] is 7 and second[i][j] is 2 \u2192 3, else 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nFirst group row0: [7,7,0,7]\n\nSecond group row0 (row6): [0,0,0,0]\n\nSo no 7 and 2 in same position. So output row0 would be all 0s. But Example0's output row0 is [0,0,3,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rows are transposed or there's another arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the first group's columns and the second group's rows. For example, each cell (i,j) in the output is 3 if there's a 7 in column j of the first group's row i and a 2 in row i of the second group's column j. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by overlaying the two grids and where both have non-zero values (7 and 2), output 3. But again, this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs are 4x4 grids. The fifth row in the input is always [4,4,4,4], which might indicate that the input is divided into two parts: the first four rows (group A) and the next four rows (group B). Maybe each group A and group B are matrices that are multiplied or combined in some way to produce the output. For instance, matrix multiplication where 7 and 2 are treated as binary flags. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 3 in the output corresponds to a position where group A has a 7 and group B has a 2 in the same position, but group B is rotated or transformed in some way. For example, group B is flipped or rotated before comparison.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row0: [0,0,3,0]. If group B's row0 (row6) is [0,0,0,0], then no 2s. But where does the 3 come from? Maybe group B is rotated. For example, if group B is rotated 90 degrees, then row0 of the output corresponds to column3 of group B. Let's see.\n\nExample0's group B:\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,2,0,2]\n\nRow8: [2,2,2,0]\n\nRow9: [2,0,0,2]\n\nRotating this 90 degrees clockwise would give columns as rows in reverse order. For example, rotated group B would have:\n\nRow0: [2,0,2,0] (from column3 of group B rows reversed: row9's column3 is 2, row8's column3 is0, row7's column3 is2, row6's column3 is0 \u2192 reversed as row6,7,8,9 \u2192 so column3 is 0,2,0,2 \u2192 but rotated 90 degrees would be different. Maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe group B is transposed. Then, group B's rows become columns, and vice versa. Let's check. Group B's transposed would have columns as:\n\nCol0: 0,0,2,2 (rows6-9, col0)\n\nCol1:0,2,2,0 (col1)\n\nCol2:0,0,2,0 (col2)\n\nCol3:0,2,0,2 (col3)\n\nSo transposed group B is:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,2,0,2]\n\nRow2: [2,2,2,0]\n\nRow3: [2,0,0,2]\n\nWhich is the same as the original group B. So transposing doesn't change it. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the positions of the 3s in the outputs and see if they correlate to specific patterns.\n\nExample0's output:\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 3s are at (0,2) and (1,0).\n\nIn the group A (rows0-3) for Example0:\n\nRow0: [7,7,0,7]\n\nRow1: [0,7,7,0]\n\nRow2: [0,7,7,7]\n\nRow3: [0,7,7,0]\n\nGroup B (rows6-9):\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,2,0,2]\n\nRow8: [2,2,2,0]\n\nRow9: [2,0,0,2]\n\nLooking at the 3 in output (0,2): perhaps this is from group A row0 and group B row8 (since group B's row8, column2 is 2. Group A row0, column2 is0. So that doesn't explain it.\n\nAlternatively, output (0,2) could be from group A row2 (which has 7 in column2) and group B row8 (which has 2 in column2). So maybe the output row is the sum of the group A row and group B row, but how?\n\nWait, group A row2 is [0,7,7,7], group B row8 is [2,2,2,0]. Adding them would be [2,9,9,7], which is not relevant. But the output has 3s. Maybe where group A has 7 and group B has 2, their sum is 9, which modulo 6 is 3? 7+2=9 \u2192 9 mod 6=3. That's a possibility. Let's check.\n\nIf output cell is (7 + 2) mod 6 = 9 mod6=3. Other combinations: 0+0=0, 0+2=2 mod6=2, 7+0=7 mod6=1. So only when both are 7 and 2, it gives 3. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's output, (0,2) is 3. group A row0, column2 is0, group B row0 (row6) column2 is0. 0+0=0 mod6=0. So that's not it.\n\nBut perhaps group B is rows6-9, and each output row is formed by adding group A row and group B row (i.e., output row0 is group A row0 + group B row0, etc.), then mod6. But group A row0 is [7,7,0,7], group B row0 (row6) is [0,0,0,0]. Sum is [7,7,0,7] mod6 \u2192 [1,1,0,1]. Not matching output.\n\nAlternatively, multiply group A and group B elements. 7*2=14 \u2192 14 mod something. But 14 mod11 is 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are simply the count of overlapping 7s and 2s in the same position across all possible pairs of rows from group A and group B. But this would require a different structure.\n\nMaybe it's time to look for another pattern. Let's consider that the output is generated by some kind of shift or rotation based on the input's groups.\n\nIn Example0's output, there are two 3s. Let's see where they are located. The first 3 is at (0,2) and the second at (1,0). In group A, row0 has a 0 in column2, row1 has a 7 in column0. Group B row0 (row6) is all zeros, row7 (group B row1) has 2s at columns1 and3.\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, perhaps the output is a result of some kind of maze-solving or pathfinding through the groups, but that seems unlikely given the time constraints.\n\nAnother thought: Each 3 in the output corresponds to a cell where, in the same column, there are an equal number of 7s in group A and 2s in group B. For example, if column j has m 7s in group A and n 2s in group B, then if m equals n, output 3 in that column. But let's check.\n\nExample0's column0:\n\nGroup A: 7 (row0), 0,0,0 \u2192 1 seven.\n\nGroup B: 0,0,2,2 \u2192 2 twos. 1\u22602 \u2192 no 3.\n\nExample0's column2:\n\nGroup A: 0,7,7,7 \u2192 3 sevens.\n\nGroup B: 0,0,2,0 \u2192 1 two. 3\u22601 \u2192 no 3. But output column2 in row0 is 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: The number of 3s in a column is the minimum of the number of 7s in group A and 2s in group B for that column. But in Example0's column2, min(3,1)=1. But the output has one 3 in that column. So maybe each 3 represents one occurrence of the minimum. But how to determine the rows.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, the number of 3s in the output is equal to the number of 2s in group B for that column, provided there are enough 7s in group A. So if group B has n 2s in column j, and group A has at least n 7s in column j, then output n 3s in that column. Let's check.\n\nExample0's column2:\n\nGroup B has 1 two. Group A has 3 sevens. So output 1 3 in column2. Which is what we see: one 3 in column2. Example0's column1:\n\nGroup B has 3 twos (rows7,8,9 have 2s in column1: row7 has 2 in column1? Wait, group B rows6-9 are:\n\nrow6: [0,0,0,0]\n\nrow7: [0,2,0,2] \u2192 column1 is 2.\n\nrow8: [2,2,2,0] \u2192 column1 is2.\n\nrow9: [2,0,0,2] \u2192 column1 is0.\n\nSo column1 in group B has 2s in row7 and row8 \u2192 2 twos.\n\nGroup A column1 has 7s in all four rows. So output would have 2 3s in column1. But looking at Example0's output, column1 has no 3s. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let me try to look for a different approach. Maybe the output is derived from the positions where group A and group B have certain values, but the rows are arranged in a specific way.\n\nLooking at Example1's input:\n\nGroup A:\n\n[0,0,7,7]\n\n[0,0,7,7]\n\n[0,7,7,0]\n\n[7,7,0,0]\n\nGroup B (rows6-9):\n\n[2,0,2,0]\n\n[0,2,0,2]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,3]\n\nThe output has 3s at (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,3), (3,3).\n\nLooking at group B's 2s: \n\nrow6: positions0 and2.\n\nrow7: positions1 and3.\n\nrow8: positions1 and2.\n\nrow9: position2.\n\nSo group B has 2s in positions:\n\nrow6:0,2\n\nrow7:1,3\n\nrow8:1,2\n\nrow9:2\n\nNow, looking at group A's 7s in the same positions:\n\nFor output cell (0,1):\n\nThis would be group A row0, column1:0. group B row0 (row6) column1:0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell (i,j) is 3 if group B's row i has a 2 in column j and group A's row i has a 7 in column j. Let's check.\n\nFor output cell (0,1) (row0, column1):\n\ngroup B row0 (row6) column1 is0. So no. Not matching.\n\nFor output cell (1,0) (row1, column0):\n\ngroup B row1 (row7) column0 is0. So no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell (i,j) is 3 if group B's row j has a 2 in column i. And group A's row j has a 7 in column i. This is transposed.\n\nExample1's output cell (0,1) would be row0, column1. group B's row1 (row7) column0 is0. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by counting, for each cell in group B's row i, column j, if there's a 2, then check group A's row j, column i for a 7. If so, output 3 in cell (i,j).\n\nFor Example1's output cell (0,1) (row0, column1):\n\ngroup B's row0 (row6) column1 is0 \u2192 no.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output's 3s and see if they correspond to the positions of 2s in group B, but shifted in some way. For example, in Example0's output, the 3s are at (0,2) and (1,0). group B has 2s at positions (7,1), (7,3), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,3). So maybe these are mapped to different positions in the output. For example, the 2s in group B's row7 (row1 of group B) columns1 and3 \u2192 output row1, columns1 and3, but output row1 in Example0 is [3,0,0,0]. So not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the row index in group B plus the group A's row index equals the output row index. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs and see if there's a common structure.\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\nExample0's output:\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nExample1's output:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,3]\n\nExample2's output:\n\n[3,3,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\nExample3's output:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[3,3,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\nNoticing that the 3s often appear in the corners or edges. Maybe it's a maze-like path where 3s are steps. But not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output grids have exactly four rows, which matches the number of rows in group A and group B. So perhaps each output row is a combination of a row from group A and a row from group B.\n\nWait, group A has four rows (0-3), group B has four rows (6-9). The output has four rows. Maybe each output row i is determined by group A row i and group B row i.\n\nFor example, for output row i, cell j is 3 if group A row i, j is 7 and group B row i, j is 2. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's group A row0: [7,7,0,7]\n\ngroup B row0 (row6): [0,0,0,0]\n\nSo output row0 would have 0s everywhere. But Example0's output row0 has a 3 in column2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe group B is shifted. For example, group B's row i is mapped to group A's row (i + something) mod4. Let's try Example0's output row0, column2. If group B's row2 (row8) has a 2 in column2. Group A row0, column2 is0. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe group B's rows are reversed. So group B row0 is input row9, group B row1 is row8, etc. Let's see.\n\nFor Example0's output row0, column2: group B row0 (row9) column2 is0. group A row0, column2 is0. Still no.\n\nAnother possibility: For each cell in the output, if the corresponding cell in group A is 7 and any cell in group B's same column is 2, then output 3. But how to determine the row. For example, if group A's cell (i,j) is7, and any of group B's cells in column j is2, then output[i][j] is3.\n\nIn Example0, group A row0, column0 is7. group B's column0 has 2s in rows8 and9. So output row0, column0 would be3. But Example0's output row0, column0 is0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the other way around: if group B's cell (i,j) is2 and group A's cell (i,j) is7, then output[i][j] is3. But in Example0, group B's row8 (which is group B's row2) column0 is2. group A's row2, column0 is0. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a pattern in the output positions and see if they align with certain movements.\n\nLooking at Example0's output: 3 at (0,2) and (1,0). In group B, the 2s are in rows7,8,9.\n\nIn group B row7 (input row7), columns1 and3 are 2. If we map these to output row1, columns1 and3, but output row1 has 3 in column0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by shifting the 2s in group B left or right and overlapping with group A's 7s.\n\nAnother idea: The output is created by placing a 3 wherever there's a 7 in group A and a 2 in group B, but the 2s are shifted in a certain direction. For example, group B's rows are shifted up by one, so group B row0 becomes row1 in the output. \n\nFor Example0's output row0, column2: group B row0 (row6) is all zeros. So no. Doesn't explain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a diagonal combination. For example, output[i][j] is 3 if group A[i][j] is7 and group B[j][i] is2. Let's check.\n\nExample0's output row0, column2: group A row0, column2 is0. group B column0, row2 is2 (group B row2 is row8, column0 is2). So 0 and 2. Not 3.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the output is generated by some other operation, like counting the number of 7s and 2s in cross positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the result of treating group A and group B as binary matrices (7=1, 2=1, others=0), and performing a logical AND between corresponding elements, then multiplying by 3. But then, only where both are 1 (7 and 2) would 3 appear.\n\nIn Example0's group A row0: [1,1,0,1] (assuming 7=1), group B row0: [0,0,0,0]. AND would be all 0. So output row0 is 0s. Doesn't match.\n\nBut in group B row7 (row1 of group B) column1 is2 (treated as1), group A row1 column1 is7 (1). So AND is1 \u2192 3. Output row1, column1 would be3. But Example0's output row1 has 3 in column0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach seems incorrect.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the output is created by taking each 2 in group B and, for its position (i,j), placing a 3 in the output at position (j,i) if there's a 7 in group A's row j, column i. Let's check.\n\nFor Example0's group B row7 (group B row1) has 2s at columns1 and3. So flipping these to (1,1) and (1,3). Then check group A's row1, column1 and row1, column3. group A row1 is [0,7,7,0]. So column1 is7, column3 is0. So output would have 3 at (1,1) and no at (1,3). But Example0's output row1 is [3,0,0,0]. So no match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the transpose of group B, and wherever there's a 2, if group A has a 7 in that position, then 3. For Example0, group B's transpose would be:\n\nrow0: [0,0,2,2]\n\nrow1: [0,2,2,0]\n\nrow2: [0,0,2,0]\n\nrow3: [0,2,0,2]\n\nSo output would check group A's same position. For example, output row0, column0 is group B transposed row0, column0:0, group A row0, column0:7. So no. Doesn't explain.\n\nI think I'm running out of time and need to make a guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[7,7,7,7]\n\n[0,7,7,7]\n\n[7,0,0,0]\n\n[7,0,7,0]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[0,2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,2,2]\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\nSo group A is the first four rows:\n\nRow0:7,7,7,7\n\nRow1:0,7,7,7\n\nRow2:7,0,0,0\n\nRow3:7,0,7,0\n\nGroup B is rows6-9:\n\nRow6:0,2,2,2\n\nRow7:0,0,0,0\n\nRow8:2,0,2,2\n\nRow9:0,2,0,0\n\nNow, looking for patterns in the examples, perhaps the output is created by placing a 3 wherever group B has a 2 and group A has a 7 in the same column. But how the rows are determined.\n\nAlternatively, for each 2 in group B's row i, column j, if there's a 7 in group A's row i, column j, then output 3 in row i, column j.\n\nSo let's check the test input's group B:\n\nRow6 (group B row0): columns1,2,3 have 2s. group A row0's columns1,2,3 have 7s. So output row0, columns1,2,3 would be3s.\n\nRow7 (group B row1): all zeros. So no 3s.\n\nRow8 (group B row2): columns0,2,3 have 2s. group A row2's columns0,2,3: row2 is [7,0,0,0]. So columns0 is7, others 0. So output row2, column0 is3.\n\nRow9 (group B row3): column1 has 2. group A row3's column1 is0. So no.\n\nSo output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [3,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the examples, the outputs are 4x4 grids with 3s in various positions, but none have multiple 3s in the same row like this. Also, this doesn't match any of the training examples. For instance, Example0's output only has two 3s, but according to this pattern, there would be more. So this approach must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's only the first occurrence in the column. Or perhaps the output row corresponds to the group B row, and for each 2 in group B row i, column j, if group A row i has a 7 in column j, then output 3 in position (i,j).\n\nLet's test this with the test input:\n\ngroup B row0 (row6): columns1,2,3 have 2s.\n\ngroup A row0: all 7s. So columns1,2,3 are 7s. So output row0 would be [0,3,3,3].\n\ngroup B row1 (row7): no 2s.\n\ngroup B row2 (row8): columns0,2,3 have 2s. group A row2 is [7,0,0,0]. So column0 has 7. So output row2 would have 3 in column0.\n\ngroup B row3 (row9): column1 has 2. group A row3 is [7,0,7,0]. Column1 is0. So no.\n\nThus, output would be:\n\n[0,3,3,3]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\n[3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs don't have such patterns. For example, Example1's output has 3s in multiple rows. So this approach might be incorrect.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output is determined by the positions where group A and group B's columns have a 7 and 2 respectively, and the row in the output is determined by the row in group B. For example, each 2 in group B's row i, column j contributes to output row i's column j if there's a 7 in group A's column j. But the row in group A might not matter.\n\nIn test input group B row6 (row0) has 2s in columns1,2,3. group A's columns1,2,3 have 7s in multiple rows. So output row0, columns1,2,3 would be 3s. But according to the training examples, this might not be the case.\n\nBut in Example0's group B row7 (row1 of group B) has 2s in columns1 and3. group A's columns1 and3 have 7s in various rows. The output row1 has 3 in column0. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given time constraints, I'll make a guess based on the idea that each 3 in the output corresponds to a 2 in group B's row and column, and there's a 7 in group A's corresponding row and column. But in the test input's group B row8 (row2 of group B), columns0,2,3 have 2s. Group A's row2 has 7 in column0. So output row2, column0 would be3. Similarly, group B row6 has 2s in columns1,2,3. Group A row0 has 7s in those columns. So output row0, columns1,2,3 would be3s. But looking at the training examples, this approach might not be correct. However, given the time, I'll proceed with this and see what happens.",
