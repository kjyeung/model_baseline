        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input has some non-zero numbers, and the output seems to generate a symmetrical structure around those numbers. Let's start with Example 0. The input has a 2 and a 3 in the third row, and then a 3 and 2 in the eighth row. The output creates these diamond-like shapes with 3s and 2s, and some 5s in between. Also, the 5s are positioned in a cross pattern. Maybe the non-zero numbers are centers for some kind of expansion.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 1 and an 8, and their positions are mirrored. The output creates a similar structure with 8s and 1s, surrounded by 5s. The 5s are again in cross positions. So perhaps each non-zero number creates a diamond shape around it, with the number itself in the center, and then surrounding layers of the same number and maybe the other number. Also, the 5s might be where the two different numbers' expansions intersect.\n\nLooking at Example 2, there's a 2 and a 4. The output has diamonds of 4 and 2, with 5s where they cross. The same pattern here: each number creates a diamond, and their intersections are 5. So the rule could be: for each non-zero number in the input, create a diamond shape around it, with layers of the same number, and where two diamonds from different numbers overlap, replace with 5.\n\nBut how exactly are the diamonds formed? Let's check the first example. The 2 in row 2, position 1 (assuming 0-based index) has a diamond that in the output, around it, there's 3s. Wait, wait, in Example 0's input, the numbers are 2 and 3. The output has 3s and 2s in the diamond shapes. Maybe the diamond is created by the other number? Like, when there's a 2, the surrounding layers are 3s and vice versa. Or maybe it's a swap: the number x in the input creates a diamond of the other number y, and vice versa.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input has 2 and 3. The output has 3s and 2s in their respective diamonds. So maybe each number x creates a diamond of the other number. Then, when they cross, it's 5.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 2 is in row 2, column 1 (maybe 0-based), and the 3 is in row 2, column 6. Then in the output, around the 2's position, there's a diamond of 3s, and around the 3's position, a diamond of 2s. Then where those diamonds overlap, like the center line between them, there's 5s. Similarly, in Example 1, the 1 and 8 create diamonds of each other's numbers. So the pattern seems to be: for each non-zero number in the input, create a diamond shape where each layer is filled with the other number. For example, if the input has a 2 and a 3, then each 2 creates a diamond of 3s around it, and each 3 creates a diamond of 2s. The overlapping regions between two different numbers become 5.\n\nAdditionally, the 5s are placed at positions that are equidistant from both numbers. For instance, in Example 0, the 2 and 3 are a certain distance apart. The 5s are in the middle between them. So the 5s are formed where the diamonds from different numbers intersect.\n\nNow, how is the diamond structure formed? Let's look at Example 0. The input has a 2 at (row 2, column 1) and a 3 at (row 2, column 6). The output shows around the 2, a diamond of 3s. The diamond shape seems to have layers. For example, the first layer around the 2 is a 3x3 square with 3s, then a larger diamond. Wait, looking at the output rows for Example 0:\n\nIn the output, the 3's diamond starts in row 1 (0-based?) with [3,3,3,0...], then row 2 has [3,2,3,5...], which suggests that the 2 is the original input point. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let's see:\n\nInput for Example 0 has a 2 in row 2 (third row) and column 1 (second element). The output's row 2 (third row) is [3, 2, 3, 5, 5, 2, 3, 2, 0...]. So the original 2 is at position (2,1) in the input. In the output, that position is 2. Then surrounding it are 3s. So the 2's position remains 2, but around it, there are layers of 3s. Similarly, the 3 in the input is at (2,6) and becomes a 3 in the output, surrounded by 2s.\n\nWait, maybe the original number stays, and the surrounding layers are the other number. So for each non-zero number x, create a diamond around it where each ring is filled with the other number. Then, where two different numbers' diamonds overlap, it's 5.\n\nSo for the input numbers x and y, the output places x at its original position, then layers of y around it, and vice versa for y. Where these layers from different numbers meet, the cells become 5.\n\nBut how to determine the layers? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 is at (2,1). The output has layers of 3s around it. The 3 is at (8,6), and has layers of 2s around it. The diamonds seem to spread in a Manhattan distance (like a diamond shape expanding in steps). For example, the first layer around a point would be all cells at a Manhattan distance of 1, then 2, etc. But maybe it's a fixed size. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the 2's diamond in the output has 3s in positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 0-2 are 3s (assuming 0-based), row 2 has 3 in columns 0, 2, 3, etc. Maybe each diamond is a cross expanding in four directions. Alternatively, it's a 3x3 square centered at the original point, then expanding further. Wait, maybe each diamond is created by expanding in all four directions (up, down, left, right) by the same number of steps. For example, the first layer (distance 1) would be the four adjacent cells. The next layer (distance 2) adds the diagonals? Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output for the 2's position (row 2, column 1). The 3s around it are in rows 1,2,3 and columns 0,1,2. Hmm, maybe it's a 3x3 square centered at the original point. But then, how do the layers expand? Let's check the other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 1 at row 3, column 2 and 8 at row 14, column 10. The output creates diamonds of 8 around the 1 and 1 around the 8. The 8's diamond in the output includes rows 14-16 and columns 8-10 (approx). The 1's diamond is around row 3 and column 10. The 5s are at the intersections between these two diamonds.\n\nSo perhaps the diamond is a cross that expands vertically and horizontally. For example, each non-zero number x creates a cross of the other number y, with the length of the cross arms increasing with distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diamond is created by adding cells in all four directions (up, down, left, right) by a certain number of steps. For example, for each x in the input, we create a cross shape (like a plus sign) where each arm is length 2. Then, overlapping areas between different x's crosses become 5.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the 2's position (row 2, column 1) has a cross of 3s. The cross spans rows 1-3 (so three rows) and columns 0-2 (three columns). The center is the original 2. Then, the 3s form a cross. But in row 1, columns 0-2 are all 3s, which is a horizontal line of three. In row 2, column 0 is 3, then 2 in column 1, then 3 in column 2. Then row 3, columns 0-2 are 3s again. So it's a 3x3 square with a cross in the middle. Wait, no\u2014 it's more like a diamond shape. Maybe the pattern is:\n\nFor each non-zero number x at (i,j), create a diamond-shaped area where each layer is filled with the other number. The layers could be:\n\n- Layer 1: cells at Manhattan distance 1 from (i,j) \u2192 forms a diamond shape with 4 cells.\n- Layer 2: cells at Manhattan distance 2 \u2192 forms a larger diamond.\n\nBut in the examples, the diamonds seem to have a certain spread. Let me think again. In Example 0's output, around the 2 (input), the 3s form a cross that spans three rows and three columns, with the original 2 in the center. Then, in row 1, columns 0-2 are 3s, in row 2, columns 0 and 2 are 3, and column 3 (maybe) has 5. Wait, perhaps the diamonds are formed by expanding two steps in each direction. For example, the 3s around the 2 are two steps away. But I'm not exactly sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of layers depends on the distance between the two original points. For example, in Example 0, the 2 and 3 are a certain distance apart, and the diamonds expand until they meet, creating a 5 in the middle. So each diamond expands until they meet, and the overlapping points are 5.\n\nAnother approach: looking at Example 2's input, which has 2 and 4. The output creates diamonds of 4 and 2, and their intersection has 5s. The 5s are in positions that are equidistant from both original points. So the 5s form a line between the two points. So maybe the rule is: between two original points, the cells that lie exactly halfway between them (Manhattan distance) are set to 5. Also, the diamonds are built such that each layer alternates between the numbers, but maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each original number creates a 'wave' of their counterpart number expanding outward. When two waves meet, they create 5. For example, the 2 in the input creates a wave of 3s expanding outward, and the 3 creates a wave of 2s. The points where these waves meet become 5.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. For each non-zero number in the input, determine the other number (if there are two numbers, like 2 and 3, 1 and 8, etc.).\n\n2. For each such number, generate a diamond-shaped area around it, filling it with the other number. \n\n3. Where these areas overlap (i.e., cells that are in both diamonds), set those cells to 5.\n\nBut how to determine the size of the diamond? Looking at the examples, the diamonds seem to expand until they meet. For instance, in Example 0, the distance between the 2 and 3 is 5 columns (positions 1 and 6 in row 2). The 5s are in the middle, at column 3-4. So the diamonds must expand enough to meet in the middle. So the diamond's expansion is such that it reaches halfway between the two points.\n\nAlternatively, the diamonds are created by expanding each number's counterpart until they meet, and the overlapping cells are 5. So the size of the diamond is determined by the distance between the two original numbers.\n\nIn Example 0, the original 2 and 3 are in the same row, columns 1 and 6 (difference of 5). The midpoint is at column 3.5, so the 5s are around columns 3 and 4. In the output, the 5s are in columns 3 and 4 of row 2. So the diamonds expand until they meet, and the overlapping cells are 5.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- Identify pairs of non-zero numbers. Each pair consists of two different numbers (like 2 and 3, 1 and 8, etc.).\n\n- For each pair, calculate the Manhattan distance between them. The expansion for each number's diamond would be half the distance (rounded up or down), so that their diamonds meet in the middle.\n\nWait, but the distance in Example 0 between the 2 and 3 is 5 columns. The midpoint is at 3.5, so each diamond expands 2.5 cells, which in practice would be 3 cells. So each diamond expands up to the midpoint.\n\nSo, for each number in the input, the diamond is formed by cells within a certain distance from it, determined by the distance to the other number. The expansion is such that the diamonds meet in the middle, creating the 5s.\n\nBut how to handle when there are more than two numbers? The training examples have two non-zero numbers each. For instance, Example 3's input has 3 and 8, and the output has their diamonds.\n\nThe test input has 4 and 1. Let's look at that:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 4 (0-based index 4) has a 4 at column 2, and row 15 (index 15) has a 1 at column 12. The distance between them vertically is 15 -4 =11 rows. Horizontally, 12-2=10 columns. The Manhattan distance is 11 +10=21. The midpoint would be at 5.5 rows down from 4 (row 4 + 5.5 = row 9.5) and 5 columns right from column 2 (column 7). So the 5s would be along the line connecting (4,2) and (15,12), at the midpoint. But maybe the expansion is such that each diamond reaches halfway.\n\nAlternatively, since in Example 0, the distance between the two numbers is 5 columns, and the diamonds expand 3 columns (from column 1 to column 6 for the 2's diamond?), but the midpoint is columns 3-4. Hmm, maybe the diamond expands in such a way that the layers are determined by the distance to the other number.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the diamonds as follows:\n\nFor each non-zero number x at position (i,j), the diamond consists of all cells (k,l) where the Manhattan distance from (i,j) to (k,l) is less than or equal to the Manhattan distance from (i,j) to the other number's position divided by 2. Because that way, the diamonds would meet at the midpoint.\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the distance between the 2 (i=2, j=1) and 3 (i=8, j=6) is 6 rows and 5 columns, Manhattan distance is 6+5=11. Divided by 2 is 5.5. So the diamonds would expand up to Manhattan distance 5 from each. So the 2's diamond would include all cells within Manhattan distance 5 from (2,1), and the 3's diamond within Manhattan distance 5 from (8,6). The overlapping cells would be those where the Manhattan distance to both is \u22645. The cells exactly in the middle would be where the sum of distances equals the total distance divided by 2, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the midpoint.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's look for a pattern in the existing examples.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput 2 is at (2,1), 3 at (8,6). The output for 2's diamond has 3s in a pattern that extends to row 1-3 and columns 0-2. The 3's diamond has 2s in rows 7-9 and columns 5-7.\n\nThe 5s are in between. For example, in row 4, columns 5 and 6 have 5s. Maybe the diamonds expand in a way that they each reach halfway. The vertical distance between 2 and 3 is 6 rows (8-2=6). So halfway is 3 rows down from 2 (row 5) and 3 rows up from 8 (row 5). Similarly, horizontal distance is 5 columns (6-1=5), halfway is 2.5 columns. So the midpoint is at row 5, column 3.5. The 5s in the output are in rows 4 and 5, columns 3 and 4. So perhaps the diamonds expand to reach this midpoint.\n\nBut how is the diamond shape formed around each number? Let's look at another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 1 at (3,2) and 8 at (14,10). The vertical distance is 11 rows, horizontal is 8 columns. Midpoint would be row (3 +14)/2= 8.5, column (2+10)/2=6. The output's 5s are along this midpoint. The diamonds for 1 and 8 would expand to cover up to the midpoint.\n\nBut how to model the layers. Maybe each number's diamond is a series of concentric layers, each layer being the other number. The size of the diamond depends on the distance to the other number.\n\nAlternatively, each number's diamond is a cross that extends towards the other number. For example, the 2 in Example 0 extends right and down towards the 3, creating a cross of 3s. The 3 extends left and up towards the 2, creating a cross of 2s. Where these crosses meet, they form 5s.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 0, the 3's diamond around the 2 has a vertical column of 3s from row 1 to 3, and a horizontal row spanning columns 0-2. Similarly, the 2's diamond around the 3 has a vertical column from row 7-9 and columns 5-7.\n\nThe 5s appear in the area where the two crosses meet. For example, in row 4, columns 5 and 6 are 5s. So maybe the crosses extend in the direction towards each other, and where their arms meet, the 5s are placed.\n\nAlternatively, each number's cross extends towards the other number, and the length of the cross arms is determined by the distance between them. For example, the vertical and horizontal distance determines how far each cross extends.\n\nIn Example 0, the vertical distance is 6 rows (from row 2 to 8), horizontal distance 5 columns (from 1 to 6). The cross from the 2 extends down 6 rows and right 5 columns. Wait, but the output's diamond for the 2 in Example 0 is much smaller. So perhaps this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the cross arms extend in all four directions, but only up to a certain distance. For instance, for each number, the cross arms extend as far as needed to reach the midpoint between them.\n\nBut this is getting a bit unclear. Let's try to come up with a possible rule:\n\n1. For each pair of non-zero numbers (x, y) in the input:\n\n   a. Determine the midpoint between their positions.\n\n   b. Expand a diamond from each number towards the midpoint, filling with y around x and x around y.\n\n   c. Where the two diamonds overlap (the midpoint area), set to 5.\n\nBut how to determine the shape of the diamond.\n\nAlternatively, each number's diamond consists of all cells along the path from the number to the midpoint, and expanding in a diamond shape (Manhattan distance steps) up to the midpoint.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for Example 0, the 3s around the 2 form a shape that's three rows high (rows 1-3) and three columns wide (columns 0-2). Similarly, the 2s around the 3 are three rows high (rows 7-9) and three columns wide (columns 5-7). The midpoint between (2,1) and (8,6) is (5, 3.5). The diamonds expand up to the midpoint. The vertical distance from 2 to midpoint is 3 rows, horizontal is 2.5 columns. So the diamonds might be expanding 3 rows and 2 columns, but how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, each diamond expands in a way that covers the path from the original number to the midpoint. For example, the 2's diamond includes cells that are in the direction towards the midpoint, forming a cross.\n\nBut perhaps the diamonds are formed by creating a square or diamond shape centered at each number, with the size determined by the distance to the other number. For example, if the vertical distance is 6 rows, then the diamond expands 3 rows up and down. Similarly for horizontal.\n\nSo, for vertical distance V and horizontal distance H, each diamond expands V//2 rows and H//2 columns. In Example 0, V=6 rows between 2 and 8, so V//2=3 rows. So the diamond around the 2 expands 3 rows up and down. But the 2 is at row 2, so up 3 rows would take it to row -1, which is invalid. So perhaps the expansion is clamped to the grid bounds. Hmm, that might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is based on the minimum distance between the two numbers. For example, for the 2 and 3 in Example 0, the vertical distance is 6, horizontal is 5. The minimum of V and H is 5. So the expansion is 2 steps (5//2=2). So each diamond expands 2 steps in all directions. Let's see:\n\nFor the 2 in row 2, column 1:\n\nExpanding 2 steps up (rows 0,1,2), but wait, no. Manhattan distance steps. If expanding 2 steps, then cells within a Manhattan distance of 2. So for each cell (i,j), if |i -2| + |j-1| \u2264 2, then it's part of the diamond. Let's calculate:\n\nFor example, row 0, column 1: distance is 2 (0-2=2, column 0 difference is 0). Total 2 \u2192 included.\n\nRow 1, column 0: |1-2| + |0-1| =1 +1=2 \u2192 included.\n\nRow 2, column 3: |0| + 2 \u2192 2 \u2192 included.\n\nBut in the output of Example 0, the 3's diamond around the 2 includes a larger area. For example, row 3 has a 3 in column 0, which is a Manhattan distance of 3 (3-2=1, 0-1=1 \u2192 sum 2?). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, Manhattan distance from (2,1) to (3,0) is |3-2| + |0-1|=1+1=2. So yes, that's within 2 steps. So the diamond would include that cell. But in Example 0's output, row 3, column 0 is 3. So that fits. But the diamond for the 2's 3s in the output extends from row 1 to row 3, and columns 0 to 2. So that's a Manhattan distance of 2.\n\nSo maybe each diamond is formed by cells within Manhattan distance of 2 from the original point. But why 2? Because the distance between the two points is 11 (Manhattan), so half is 5.5. Maybe the diamonds are expanded to cover half of the distance. But 11/2 is 5.5, so why expand 2 steps?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the number of layers is fixed. For example, each non-zero number creates a diamond of 3 layers (the original cell, then two layers outward). But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the diamonds are of a fixed size regardless of the distance between the points. For example, each non-zero number generates a diamond of 3x3 cells around it, but in the examples, the diamonds are larger than that.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input, which has 3 and 8. The output's diamonds are in rows 2-4 and 7-9, and columns 3-5 and 8-10. The 5s are in columns 5 and 8. So the diamonds for each number are 3 cells in each direction. Maybe each diamond is a 3x3 cross. For example, each non-zero number creates a cross of the other number in a 3x3 area. But when the two crosses are placed such that they overlap, the overlapping cells are 5.\n\nBut in Example 0, the diamonds are larger. For example, the 3's diamond around the 2 includes row 1, columns 0-2 (three cells), row 2 columns 0 and 2, and row 3 columns 0-2. So it's a 3-row high, 3-column wide cross. Similarly, the 2's diamond around the 3 is a 3x3 cross. The 5s are where these two crosses meet in the middle.\n\nBut in Example 0, the original 2 and 3 are 6 rows apart vertically. So their crosses can't reach each other unless they expand further. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the diamonds are not fixed size, but their size depends on the positions of the two numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the diamonds are formed by creating a cross that extends in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) for a number of steps equal to the minimum of the vertical and horizontal distances to the other number. For example, if the vertical distance is 6 and horizontal is 5, then the cross extends 5 steps in each direction. But this also doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the cross arms extend until they reach the midpoint. For example, the vertical arm extends from the original number down (or up) to the midpoint row, and the horizontal arm extends to the midpoint column. Then, the cross is formed by all cells in the same row or column between the original number and the midpoint.\n\nFor Example 0, the 2 is at row 2, column 1. The midpoint between (2,1) and (8,6) is row 5, column 3.5. So the vertical arm extends from row 2 to row 5 (3 steps down), and the horizontal arm extends from column 1 to 3.5 (2.5 steps right). So the cross for the 2's diamond would be rows 2-5, columns 1-3. But since the example's output for the 2's diamond is larger than that, this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, the cross arms extend in all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the original number until they reach the midpoint. For example, the 2's cross extends down 3 rows (from row 2 to row 5) and right 2 columns (from column 1 to 3). Then, the cells in those rows and columns are filled with the other number. But this also may not fit.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to find another approach. Looking at the output matrices:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 3's diamond around the 2 (input) has the following structure:\n\nRow 1: [3,3,3,0,...] \n\nRow 2: [3,2,3,5,5,2,3,2,0,...]\n\nRow 3: [3,3,3,0,...]\n\nThis seems like a cross: row 1 and 3 are filled with 3s in columns 0-2, and row 2 has 3s in columns 0 and 2, with the original 2 in column 1. So it's a cross of 3s around the 2, three cells in each direction. Then, further down, there's a cross of 2s around the 3.\n\nThe 5s appear in the area where the two crosses overlap. For example, in row 4, columns 5 and 6 are 5s.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: each non-zero number x creates a cross (3 cells in each direction) of the other number y. Then, where the crosses from x and y overlap, set to 5.\n\nBut in Example 0, the crosses for the 2 and 3 are much larger than three cells. For example, the 3's cross around the 2 extends from column 0 to 2 in rows 1-3. But the 3's cross around the 3 (original) is in rows 7-9 and columns 5-7. The midpoint between the two crosses is row 5, column 3.5. The 5s appear between them.\n\nWait, perhaps the crosses are three cells in all directions, but the overlapping occurs when the two crosses are close enough. But in Example 0, the two original points are far apart (6 rows and 5 columns), so their crosses wouldn't overlap. Unless the crosses are larger than three cells.\n\nAlternatively, the cross extends from the original point to the midpoint. So the length of the cross arms is equal to the distance to the midpoint. For example, in Example 0, the vertical distance from 2 to midpoint is 3 rows, so the cross extends down 3 rows from the 2's position.\n\nSo for the 2 at row 2, column 1:\n\n- The vertical arm extends down 3 rows to row 5.\n\n- The horizontal arm extends right 2 columns to column 3 (midpoint column 3.5, so maybe up to column 3).\n\nSo the cross for the 2 would include all cells from row 2 to row 5 (inclusive) in column 1, and all cells from column 1 to column 3 in row 2. Then, fill these cells with 3s. Similarly, the cross for the 3 would extend up 3 rows and left 2 columns.\n\nBut how would that look in the output? For example, the vertical arm for the 2's cross would be rows 2-5, column 1. The horizontal arm would be row 2, columns 1-3. So this cross would have 3s in:\n\nRow 2, columns 1-3.\n\nRows 2-5, column 1.\n\nBut in the output, the 3s are in a 3x3 area around row 2, column 1. This doesn't match. So perhaps this isn't the correct approach.\n\nAnother idea: the diamonds are created by expanding each number's counterpart in a diamond shape, but the size of the diamond is determined by the Manhattan distance between the two numbers divided by two. For example, if the distance is 11, then each diamond expands 5 cells (floor(11/2)). So each diamond would include cells within Manhattan distance 5 from the original number.\n\nIn Example 0, the distance between 2 and 3 is 6 rows +5 columns=11. Divided by 2 is 5.5, so each diamond expands 5 steps. For the 2 at (2,1), cells within Manhattan distance 5 would include rows from 2-5 up and down, and columns 1-5 left and right. But this would create a large diamond. But the output shows a much smaller diamond. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the diamond size is fixed, and the 5s are placed at the midpoint between the two numbers. For example, the midpoint between (2,1) and (8,6) is (5, 3.5). The 5s are placed at (5,3) and (5,4) in the output. So the diamonds for each number expand to the midpoint, and the cells along the path between them are filled with 5s.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe for each pair of numbers, create a line connecting them and place 5s along the line. Also, create diamonds around each number with the other number.\n\nBut in the examples, the 5s are not just along the line. For example, in Example 0's output, row 2, columns 3-4 have 5s, and row 4, columns 5-6 have 5s. So perhaps the 5s are placed at the midpoints, but also in a cross pattern around them.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 0, the structure around the original numbers is symmetrical. For example, the 2 is surrounded by a diamond of 3s, and the 3 is surrounded by a diamond of 2s. The 5s are in between, forming a kind of bridge between the two diamonds.\n\nIn Example 1, the 1 and 8 are mirrored, and the output has their diamonds mirrored as well, with 5s in between.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each pair of numbers x and y in the input, create a diamond (or cross) around x filled with y, and a diamond around y filled with x.\n\n- Where the two diamonds overlap, replace with 5.\n\n- Additionally, create a line of 5s connecting the two diamonds, possibly along the path between them.\n\nBut how to determine the shape of the diamonds and overlapping.\n\nAnother observation: in the outputs, the 5s form a cross along the midpoint between the two numbers. For example, in Example 0, between the 2 and 3, there's a vertical line of 5s in columns 3-4. In Example 1, between the 1 and 8, there's a diagonal line of 5s.\n\nWait, perhaps the 5s are placed along the line connecting the two original numbers. For example, if the two numbers are aligned vertically or horizontally, the 5s are placed in the cells along that line. If they are diagonal, the 5s form a diagonal line.\n\nIn Example 0, the two numbers are in the same row (row 2 and row 8? Wait, no. Wait, in Example 0's input, the 2 is in row 2, column 1, and the 3 is in row 8, column 6. So they are not aligned vertically or horizontally. The line between them is diagonal. The 5s in the output are along the diagonal path between them. For example, in row 4, columns 5 and 6. But the 5s are in a cross pattern.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to apply the pattern to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nThere's a 4 at row 4 (0-based), column 2.\n\nAnd a 1 at row 15, column 12.\n\nAssuming the pattern is that each number is surrounded by a diamond of the other number, and their intersection is 5s.\n\nSo for the 4 and 1:\n\n- The 4's diamond will be filled with 1s.\n\n- The 1's diamond will be filled with 4s.\n\n- Where the two diamonds overlap, set to 5.\n\nThe diamonds' shapes are likely similar to the examples, which have 3x3 cross shapes around each number. But given the distance between the two numbers (rows:15-4=11, columns:12-2=10), the diamonds might be larger.\n\nBut in the examples, the diamonds are not necessarily the same size as the distance. For example, Example 0 has a vertical distance of 6 rows, but the diamonds are 3 rows high. So maybe each diamond is half the distance rounded down.\n\nAlternatively, the diamonds expand as much as possible to meet in the middle.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nThe 4 is at (4,2), the 1 is at (15,12).\n\nThe vertical distance is 11 rows, horizontal 10 columns.\n\nThe midpoint would be at row (4+15)/2 = 9.5, column (2+12)/2=7.\n\nSo the diamonds around each number should expand to this midpoint.\n\nThe 4's diamond would expand down from row 4 to row 9.5 (so 5.5 rows), and right from column 2 to 7 (5 columns).\n\nThe 1's diamond would expand up from row 15 to row 9.5 (5.5 rows), and left from column 12 to 7 (5 columns).\n\nBut how to model the expansion. Perhaps the diamonds are formed by expanding in all directions up to the midpoint, creating a diamond shape.\n\nThe output would then have:\n\n- Around the 4 (row4, col2), a diamond of 1s expanding to row9.5 and column7. This diamond would include rows 4-9 and columns 2-7.\n\n- Around the 1 (row15, col12), a diamond of 4s expanding to row9.5 and column7. This diamond would include rows 15-10 and columns 12-7.\n\nThe overlapping area would be around row9-10 and column7, where the 5s are placed.\n\nBut how this translates into the actual output matrix.\n\nAlternatively, the diamonds are formed as cross shapes expanding towards each other, and the 5s are placed along the path between them.\n\nBut without knowing the exact rule, it's hard to say. However, based on the examples, the output seems to create a symmetrical pattern around each number, swapping their values, and placing 5s in between.\n\nFor the test input, the output should have:\n\n- Around the 4 (row4, col2), a diamond of 1s.\n\n- Around the 1 (row15, col12), a diamond of 4s.\n\n- 5s where these two diamonds overlap.\n\nAdditionally, there might be some 5s along the line connecting the two numbers.\n\nLooking at the examples, when the numbers are vertically and horizontally distant, the 5s are placed in a cross pattern along the midpoint.\n\nSo, in the test input's output, the diamond around the 4 would be a cross of 1s expanding towards the midpoint, and the diamond around the 1 would be a cross of 4s expanding towards the midpoint. The overlapping cells would be 5s.\n\nThus, the final answer should have:\n\n- Rows around row4 and column2 filled with 1s.\n\n- Rows around row15 and column12 filled with 4s.\n\n- 5s in the cells between them, especially around row9-10 and column7.\n\nLooking at the examples, the output for such a case would look like:\n\nThe 4's diamond would be a cross expanding downward and to the right, filled with 1s. The 1's diamond would be a cross expanding upward and to the left, filled with 4s. Where they meet, there would be 5s.\n\nBut the exact output requires careful calculation. Since I'm pressed for time, I'll proceed to draft the answer based on the observed patterns.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern here. Let's look at the training examples first. \n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has 2 and 3 in certain positions. The output seems to create a sort of diamond or cross pattern around those numbers. For instance, around the 2 and 3 in the input, the output has layers of numbers. The 3 is surrounded by 3s, then 2s, and some 5s. Also, the positions of 2 and 3 are mirrored vertically. The output's structure has symmetry, and 5s appear in certain positions, maybe where lines intersect or in the middle between the numbers.\n\nIn Example 1, there's 1 and 8. The output has 8s surrounding the 1, and 1s around the 8. Again, mirrored positions. The 5s are placed in the middle between them. So perhaps the pattern is that each number is surrounded by its own value, and between the two numbers (which are mirrored), there's a 5. Also, the numbers are swapped in the mirrored part. Like 1 becomes 8 and vice versa. \n\nLooking at Example 2: Input has 2 and 4. Output shows 4s around 2's position and 2s around 4's position, with 5s in between. The numbers are mirrored, and their surrounding blocks are their own values. So the transformation seems to involve taking the input numbers, placing their own value in a diamond shape around them, then swapping the values in the mirrored positions and doing the same. The 5s are placed where the lines cross between the two numbers.\n\nExample 3 has 3 and 8. The output has 8s around 3 and 3s around 8 in the mirrored positions, with 5s in the middle. So the same pattern: mirror the positions, swap the values, and create diamond shapes with 5s in the cross lines.\n\nSo the general steps seem to be:\n\n1. Identify pairs of non-zero numbers in the input that are mirrored along the vertical center line of the grid. For example, in Example 0, the 2 is in row 2, column 1 (assuming 0-based index), and the 3 is in row 8, column 6 (maybe mirrored over the middle row). Wait, the input in Example 0 has 2 at row 2 (third row) and column 1, and 3 at row 8 (ninth row), column 6. The grid is 14 rows, so the middle is between row 6 and 7. So row 2 is mirrored to row 14 - 2 - 1 = 11? Wait, maybe it's mirrored top to bottom. So if the grid is height H, then the mirror is around H/2. Let me check. For Example 0, input has 14 rows. The 2 is in row 2, and the 3 is in row 8. 14 rows, so middle is between row 6 and 7. So row 2's mirror would be row 14 - 2 -1 = 11? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the mirror is such that row i and row (total_rows -1 -i) are mirrored. So for 14 rows (indices 0-13), row 2's mirror is row 11 (13-2=11). In the input of Example 0, the 3 is in row 8. 13-8=5. Wait, but in the input, the other non-zero is in row 8. Hmm, maybe the pairs are in mirrored positions. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the non-zero elements are at (2,1) and (8,6). The total rows are 14. So the middle is between rows 6 and 7. The distance from row 2 to the middle is 6-2=4 rows. Then mirrored would be row 6+4=10? Wait, perhaps the mirroring is over the horizontal axis. Let's see: 2 and 8. The middle row is 7 (since 14 rows, index 0-13). So the distance from 2 to 7 is 5, so mirrored would be 7 +5 =12, but that's beyond. Wait, maybe it's a vertical mirror, but the positions in the same column. No, perhaps the pairs are placed symmetrically around the center of the grid. Alternatively, maybe each non-zero in the input has a counterpart in the mirrored position (over the vertical axis), and their values are swapped in the output.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, there's a 2 at (row 2, column 1) and a 3 at (row 8, column 6). Then in the output, around the 2's position, there are 3s, and around the 3's position, 2s. So the values are swapped. So the output takes the value from the mirrored position and creates a diamond around it. Also, the 5s are placed along the line connecting the two points. So the steps could be:\n\nFor each pair of mirrored non-zero elements (a and b) in the input:\n\n- In the output, create a diamond (or cross) around a's position with the value of b, and around b's position with the value of a.\n- Place 5s along the line between a and b, perhaps at certain intervals.\n\nAdditionally, the diamonds are created by surrounding the original position with three instances of the swapped number in a cross pattern, then expanding outward. The 5s might be placed where the diamonds intersect or along the path between the two points.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. The test input has 4 at row 4, column 2 (assuming rows are 0-based), and 1 at row 15, column 12. Let's check the rows. The test input has 17 rows (since the input starts with 17 lines). So the middle row is at index 8 (since 0-16). Row 4 is 4 rows below row 8, and row 15 is 7 rows below row 8. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, 17 rows, indexes 0-16. The middle is at 8 (since 16/2=8). So row 4 is 4 rows above the middle, and row 15 is 7 rows below the middle. Wait, maybe they're not exact mirrors. Let me check the positions:\n\nOriginal positions in test input:\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nLine 4 (0-based index 4) has a 4 at column 2 (third column). Line 15 (index 15) has a 1 at column 12 (13th column). The grid is 18 columns wide. The middle column is between 8 and 9 (0-based). Column 2 is left of the middle, and column 12 is right of the middle. The horizontal mirroring would be column x \u2192 17 - x (since columns 0-17). 17-2=15. But in the test input, the 1 is at column 12, which is 17-12=5. So maybe they are not mirrored in the column. Alternatively, maybe they are mirrored in the row. Wait, row 4 and row 15. The total rows are 17, so 0-16. The middle is at row 8. Row 4 is 8 -4 =4 units above, so the mirrored row would be 8 +4=12. But the 1 is in row 15, which is 7 units below. So perhaps the test input has a pair of numbers that are not exactly mirrored. Wait, but maybe the test input has a different arrangement. Let me check again:\n\nThe test input has:\n\nIn row 4 (0-based index 4), column 2 is 4.\n\nIn row 15 (index 15), column 12 is 1.\n\nSo rows 4 and 15. The total rows are 17. The middle is row 8. So 4 is 4 rows above, 15 is 7 rows below. Not exact mirrors. So maybe this pair is not mirrored. Wait, perhaps there's a vertical mirror. Let's see: perhaps the two numbers are in positions that are mirrored over the vertical axis. For example, the 4 is at (4,2) and the 1 is at (15,12). If we mirror column-wise, then for column 2, the mirrored column would be 17-2=15. But 1 is at column 12, which is not 15. So maybe this is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the test input's two numbers are not mirrored, but perhaps the pattern still applies. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the input again.\n\nWait, the test input has:\n\nLine 4: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, ... 0, 0, 1, 0, ...] Wait, the actual line is:\n\nLine 4 (index 4): [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWait, no, looking at the test input:\n\nThe test input lines are:\n\nLine 4: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWait, no, that line says: 4 is at position 2 (third element), then a bunch of zeros, then 1 at position 12 (13th element). Wait, this line has 18 elements. So in row 4, column 2 is 4, column 12 is 1. Then in row 15, column 2 is 1. Wait, the test input's line 15 is:\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the test input as given:\n\n--Test Input--\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo row 4 (0-based index 4) has a 4 at column 2 and a 1 at column 12. Then row 15 (index 15) has a 1 at column 2 and a 4 at column 12. So these are mirrored both vertically and horizontally. Because row 4 and row 15: total rows are 17 (indices 0-16). 16-4=12, so row 15 is 16-15=1. Hmm, maybe it's mirrored over the vertical axis. For example, row 4 and row 15 are mirrored around row 8.5 (since 17 rows). The distance between row 4 and 8.5 is 4.5 rows, so mirrored would be 8.5 +4.5=13, but row 15 is beyond that. Alternatively, maybe it's mirrored over the vertical axis, so row i's mirror is row (16 - i). For example, row 4's mirror is row 12 (16-4=12). But in the test input, row 15 has elements. Wait, maybe this is a different case. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the test input's non-zero entries:\n\nIn row 4, columns 2 and 12: 4 and 1.\n\nIn row 15, columns 2 and 12: 1 and 4.\n\nSo, these are arranged such that (row 4, col2)=4, (row4, col12)=1, and (row15, col2)=1, (row15, col12)=4.\n\nThis seems like a cross-mirroring. For example, each number is mirrored both vertically and horizontally. So the position (4,2) is mirrored to (15,12), and (4,12) is mirrored to (15,2). But the values are swapped. So 4 and 1 are mirrored in both row and column directions. \n\nIn this case, the output should create diamonds around each of these positions with the swapped values and place 5s in between. \n\nSo for the 4 at (4,2) and 1 at (15,12), the diamonds would be:\n\n- Around (4,2), create a diamond of 1s, since in the mirrored position (15,12) the value is 1.\n\n- Around (15,12), create a diamond of 4s.\n\nSimilarly, the 1 at (4,12) and 4 at (15,2) would also form diamonds of swapped values.\n\nWait, but in the test input's row4, the 1 is at column12, and row15's 4 is at column12. Wait, no: row4 has 4 at col2 and 1 at col12. Row15 has 1 at col2 and 4 at col12. So the mirroring is both row and column. For example, (4,2) mirrors to (15,15-2=15-2=13? Wait, columns are 0-17, so mirrored column for 2 would be 17-2=15. So (4,2) mirrors to (15,15). But the 4's mirror in the test input is at (15,12), which is column12. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is around the center of the grid. The grid is 17 rows and 18 columns. The center row is 8.5 (between 8 and 9), and center column is 8.5 (between 8 and 9). So for a point (r,c), its mirror would be (16 - r, 17 - c).\n\nSo (4,2) would mirror to (12,15). But in the test input, row15, column12 is 4. So maybe this is not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the input's non-zero elements are arranged in a cross that's mirrored both vertically and horizontally. \n\nBut perhaps the key is that each non-zero in the input is part of a pair, and each pair is mirrored across the center, and their values are swapped in the output. So for each pair (a, b), in the output, around a's position, we place b's value in a diamond shape, and around b's position, place a's value. Then connect them with 5s.\n\nSo in the test input, the pairs are (4,2) with value 4, mirrored to (15,12) with value4. Wait, no. The test input's row4 has (4 at (4,2), 1 at (4,12)). Then row15 has (1 at (15,2),4 at (15,12)). So there are two pairs: (4,2) with 4 and (15,12) with4. And (4,12) with1 and (15,2) with1. So each pair is mirrored across the grid's center.\n\nSo for each of these pairs, in the output, we need to create diamonds around their positions with the swapped value.\n\nSo for (4,2) which is 4, its mirrored pair is (15,12) which is4. Wait, no. If they are mirrored, perhaps the mirrored pairs are (4,2) and (15,15), but the test input has (15,12) as 4. So maybe the mirroring isn't exact, but the pattern applies based on the pairs present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pairs are (4,2) and (15,12) with values 4 and4, and (4,12) and (15,2) with values1 and1. Then, for each pair, in the output, the diamonds would use the other pair's value. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe each non-zero element is part of a pair, and the output uses the swapped value. But in this case, the test input has two 4s and two 1s arranged symmetrically. So perhaps the output will have diamonds of 1 around each 4, and diamonds of 4 around each1, with 5s in between.\n\nSo applying the pattern:\n\n- For each 4 in the input, create a diamond of 1s around its position.\n\n- For each1 in the input, create a diamond of4s around its position.\n\nThen, place 5s along the lines connecting the pairs.\n\nSo the diamonds would be:\n\nAround (4,2) (original 4) \u2192 create a cross of 1s.\n\nAround (4,12) (original1) \u2192 create a cross of4s.\n\nAround (15,2) (original1) \u2192 create a cross of4s.\n\nAround (15,12) (original4) \u2192 create a cross of1s.\n\nThen, between these positions, place5s along the connecting lines.\n\nBut the diamond pattern in the examples has three layers. For example, in example0, around the 2, the output has a 3x3 cross. Let me see:\n\nIn Example0's input, the 2 is at row2, column1. The output for that row has:\n\nRow2: [3,2,3,5,5,2,3,2,0,...]\n\nSo around the original 2, there's a 3 in adjacent cells. The pattern seems to be a cross expanding three cells in each direction. Wait, maybe the diamond is created by expanding one layer each step. Like:\n\nOriginal position (x,y) has value v. The output around it would have:\n\n(x-1,y) = swapped_v\n\n(x+1,y) = swapped_v\n\n(x,y-1) = swapped_v\n\n(x,y+1) = swapped_v\n\nThen, next layer:\n\n(x-2,y), (x+2,y), (x,y-2), (x,y+2), (x-1,y-1), (x-1,y+1), etc. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is a cross with three elements in each direction, creating a diamond shape. For example, in Example0's output, row1 (one above the original 2) has [3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,...]. So for the original 2, the output around it has a block of 3s (the swapped value) in the rows above and below, and to the left and right. Then, the next layer has 5s where the lines between pairs cross.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is to create a 3x3 cross around each original position, replacing with the swapped value. For example, for a position (r,c), the cross would be:\n\nr-1, c \u2192 swapped_val\n\nr+1, c \u2192 swapped_val\n\nr, c-1 \u2192 swapped_val\n\nr, c+1 \u2192 swapped_val\n\nand the corners (like r-1,c-1, etc.) are also swapped_val? Or maybe a cross expanding two layers. It's a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example0's output for row2, the original 2 is replaced with 2 in the output, surrounded by 3s. The row is [3,2,3,5,5,2,3,2,...]. So the original cell remains the same, and the surrounding cells are filled with the swapped value. Then, in the same row, the 5s are placed where the lines between the two original points cross.\n\nIn the test input, the positions with 4 and 1 are arranged in a way that they form a cross. So the diamonds would be around each of these positions with the swapped values. Then, 5s would be placed along the lines connecting them.\n\nFor example, between (4,2) and (15,12), there's a diagonal line. Along that line, place 5s. Similarly, between (4,12) and (15,2), another diagonal line with 5s.\n\nBut the examples have 5s placed in specific positions. In Example1, the 5s are in certain rows and columns. For example, in Example1's output, 5s are placed in the same row as the original numbers and in between. So perhaps the 5s are placed at the midpoint between the two original points.\n\nIn the test input, the points (4,2) and (15,12) are 11 rows apart vertically (from 4 to 15 is 11) and 10 columns apart (from 2 to 12 is 10). The midpoint would be at row (4+15)/2 =9.5, column (2+12)/2=7. So the midpoint is at row9.5, column7. Since the grid is integer indices, maybe the 5s are placed at the integer midpoints along the line. For a diagonal line, the steps would be each cell along the line, so perhaps every step between the two points, but in the examples, the 5s are placed at intervals. For instance, in Example0, between the 2 and 3, the 5s are in the same row but in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s are placed in every cell that is equidistant from both original points. But that might not fit all examples. Alternatively, the 5s are placed in the cells that form the path between the two points.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s are placed where the cross diamonds from the two original points overlap. For example, in Example0, the diamonds from the 2 and 3 overlap in the middle, and that's where the 5s are placed.\n\nIn the test input, the diamonds around (4,2) (filled with 1s) and around (15,12) (filled with1s) would expand. The diamonds from (4,2) would have 1s in their cross, and the diamonds from (15,12) would also have1s. The overlapping regions would be the 5s. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the line connecting the two points has 5s placed at certain intervals. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I need to look for the steps again:\n\n1. For each non-zero number in the input, find its mirrored counterpart. The mirrored position is determined by flipping the grid both vertically and horizontally (i.e., over the center point).\n\n2. In the output, create a diamond (cross) around each original position using the value of its mirrored counterpart.\n\n3. Place 5s in the cells that are between the two original points, perhaps along the line connecting them.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nOriginal positions:\n\n- (4,2) with value4. Its mirrored counterpart is (15-4=11 rows down? Wait, maybe the mirrored position is (16-4=12 row, 17-2=15 column). But in the test input, the mirrored position (12,15) would be out of bounds if the grid is 17 rows and 18 columns. Alternatively, the mirrored counterpart of (4,2) is (15,12) (as per the test input's 4 and 1 positions). Because in row4, column2 is4, and row15, column12 is4. Similarly, row4, column12 is1, and row15, column2 is1. So these are mirrored across the center point (row8, column8.5). So for a position (r,c), mirrored is (16 -r, 17 -c). \n\nFor example, (4,2) \u2192 (16-4=12, 17-2=15). But the test input's (15,12) has 4, not (12,15). Hmm, maybe the mirroring is different. Alternatively, the pairs are (4,2) and (15,12), which are symmetric around the grid's center. So the output would create diamonds around each of these positions with the swapped value (1 and4).\n\nSo, around (4,2), which had a4, the diamond would be filled with1s. Around (15,12), which had a4, filled with1s. Around (4,12), which had a1, filled with4s. Around (15,2), which had a1, filled with4s.\n\nThen, between these points, we need to place5s. For example, between (4,2) and (15,12), the line is a diagonal. The midpoint is (9.5,7). So around rows9 and 10, columns7 and possibly others, place5s. Similarly for the other diagonal between (4,12) and (15,2), the midpoint is (9.5,7). So maybe the 5s are placed in a cross around the center of the grid.\n\nLooking at the examples, like Example1's output has 5s in rows where the midpoints are. So in the test case, the output should have diamonds of 1s and4s around the original positions, and5s in the middle.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe output will have:\n\nAround (4,2) a diamond of1s.\n\nAround (15,12) a diamond of1s.\n\nAround (4,12) a diamond of4s.\n\nAround (15,2) a diamond of4s.\n\nAdditionally, 5s placed along the lines connecting (4,2) to (15,12), and (4,12) to (15,2).\n\nLooking at Example1, which has a similar structure, the output has three layers of diamonds and 5s in the middle. So for each pair, the diamond would be a cross expanding a few cells.\n\nFor example, around (4,2):\n\nRow3, column2:1\n\nRow4, columns1,2,3:1,4,1 (but wait, the original value is4, so the diamond is1s).\n\nWait, in Example0, the original 2 in row2, column1 is surrounded by3s. The output for that row is [3,2,3,5,5,2,3,2...]. So the original cell remains the same (2), and the adjacent cells are3. Then next to that are 5s and other numbers. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. \n\nAnother approach: look at the output layers. For each non-zero input cell, the output has a cross of three cells in each direction. For example, the first layer around the original cell is the swapped value. Then, beyond that, perhaps another layer. The 5s are placed in the intersections between different crosses.\n\nBut given the time I have, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nIn the test input, the four non-zero positions are arranged symmetrically. The output should create diamonds around each of them with swapped values. So:\n\nFor (4,2) (value4), create a diamond of1s.\n\nFor (15,12) (value4), create a diamond of1s.\n\nFor (4,12) (value1), create a diamond of4s.\n\nFor (15,2) (value1), create a diamond of4s.\n\nThen, between these points, place5s along the lines. The middle of the grid would have 5s.\n\nLooking at Example2's output, the 5s are placed in the same rows as the original points and in the middle. So perhaps in the test input, the 5s are placed along the rows and columns between the points.\n\nFinally, the output should have the following structure:\n\n- Rows near 4 and 15 will have the diamonds of 1s and4s.\n\n- Rows in the middle will have 5s where the lines cross.\n\nPutting this all together, the final answer should look like:\n\nIn the rows around 4 and15, there are diamonds of1s and4s. In the middle rows, there are 5s in columns where the lines between the points cross.",
