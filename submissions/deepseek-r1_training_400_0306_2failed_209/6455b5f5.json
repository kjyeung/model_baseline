        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples, then apply that to the test input. Let's start by looking closely at the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has several rows with 2s and 0s. The output changes some 0s to 8s and 1s. The first line in the input starts with [0,2,0...], and the output changes the first 0 to 8. Similarly, the last line of the input in that example has a 2 near the end, and the output changes the last element to 8. Then, in the lines after that, a lot of the 0s turn into 1s.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's first row has a 2 followed by 0s. The output changes the next elements after the 2 into 8s. Also, the subsequent rows have 0s turned into 1s starting from a certain position. \n\nExample 2's input has a structure where some 0s around 2s become 8s and 1s. The output seems to replace certain 0s with 8s where they are adjacent to 2s, maybe in a horizontal line. Then the following elements are 1s. \n\nAnother observation: in all examples, whenever there's a 2, the 0s that follow in the same row, starting from some point, turn into 1s. But sometimes, there are 8s introduced. The 8s might be at the ends of sequences of 2s. Like in Example 0, the first line's first element (0) becomes 8 when followed by a 2. Similarly, the last line of Example 0's input has a 2, and the last element is 8. \n\nWait, maybe the 8s are replacing 0s that are at the start or end of a contiguous block of 2s? Or maybe they are at the ends of the 2s' \"paths\". Let me check.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input line: [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,...]. The output changes the first element to 8. But the 2 is in position 1. Hmm. Then there's another 2 at position 6. In the output, the first element is 8, then 2, then the rest are 0s until the next 2. So maybe the 8 is replacing the 0 that is adjacent to the first 2 in that row. Wait, but the first 0 is before the 2. Oh, maybe the 8s are placed at the ends of the 2 structures. Like, if there's a 2 that's part of a line, the 8s are at the start and end of that line?\n\nWait in Example 0, the first input row is [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,...]. The output changes the first 0 to 8. Then the 2 is followed by 0s and another 2. So maybe the 8 is at the start and end of a path made by 2s. But in that case, the first 2 is preceded by a 0, which becomes 8, and the next 2 is in position 6. Then after that, there's another 2 in position 6. The output for that first line has 8 in position 0, then 2 in position 1, then 0s until the next 2. So maybe whenever a 2 is part of a horizontal line, the 0s adjacent to the start and end of that line become 8s.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s are replacing 0s that are adjacent to 2s in certain positions. Alternatively, perhaps the pattern involves replacing the first and last 0 in a row that are adjacent to 2s with 8s, and all other 0s after the first 2 in a row turn into 1s. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row is [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,...]. The output changes the elements after the 2 to 8s. The output is [0,0,0,0,2,8,8,...]. So after the 2, the 0s become 8s. Wait, but in the output, the 2 is followed by 8s. But in the input, the row after that has 2s followed by 2s. Maybe the 8s are only at the end of a 2 sequence. Or perhaps when a row starts with 0s leading up to a 2, then all 0s after the 2 become 8s. But in Example 0's first line, the 2 is in the second position, and the first 0 becomes 8, but the rest before the next 2 are 0s. Hmm, maybe that's not it.\n\nLooking at the outputs again, another pattern: In Example 0, the lines that are part of the \"body\" (like the middle rows) have some 2s and 0s. The output changes some 0s to 1s. For instance, the lines starting from line 10 in the input (the 0,0,2,0...) have their outputs changed to 1s in the positions after the 2. So after the 2 in position 2 of those rows, all 0s become 1s. So maybe the rule is: in each row, after the first occurrence of 2 (or after the last occurrence?), all 0s are converted to 1s. And additionally, certain 0s adjacent to the 2s are turned into 8s.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. For each row, identify where the 2s are.\n\n2. Convert all 0s after the first 2 (or after the last 2) in each row to 1s.\n\n3. Additionally, replace certain 0s adjacent to 2s with 8s. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0, the first line of input is [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,...], and the output is [8,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,...]. So the 0 before the 2 is changed to 8. Then the next 0s before the next 2 are kept as 0. Then the last 0 in the row (position 12?) is changed to 8 in line 8's output. So perhaps 8s are placed where there are 0s that are adjacent to the start or end of a 2's path in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 8s are placed at the first and last occurrence of 0s that are adjacent to 2s in the row. For example, in a row where there's a 2, the first 0 before the first 2 is replaced with 8, and the first 0 after the last 2 is replaced with 8. But in Example 1's first input line, [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,...], the output is [0,0,0,0,2,8,8,8...]. Here, the 0s after the 2 are replaced with 8s. So that contradicts the earlier idea. Wait, but in the output, all those 0s after the 2 are turned into 8s. So perhaps in that row, the 2 is the last one, and the 0s after it are replaced with 8s. But in other cases, like the first row of Example 0, there are two 2s. The first 0 before the first 2 is turned into 8, and the last 0 after the last 2 is turned into 8. Then, the 0s between the two 2s remain 0s. But in the output of Example 0's first line, the first 0 is 8, then 2, then 0s until the next 2. So maybe the 8s are only at the start and end of the entire 2 sequence in the row.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: For each row, if there's a 2, the first 0 before the first 2 in the row becomes 8, and the first 0 after the last 2 becomes 8. Then, all other 0s after the first 2 in the row become 1s. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nTake Example 0's first input row:\n\nInput: [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nFirst 0 before first 2 is index 0. So that becomes 8. The first 0 after last 2 (last 2 is at index 6) is index 7. So in the output, index 7 would become 8. But the output is [8,2,0,0,0,0,2,0, ...]. So index 7 is 0 in output. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed at the ends of the row where 2s are present. For example, if the row starts or ends with 2s, then the adjacent 0s are 8s. But that also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2's input and output. The input's first row is [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,...]. The output is [0,0,0,2,8,8,8,2,1,1,...]. So here, between the two 2s, the 0s are replaced with 8s, and after the last 2, they're 1s. So between the 2s, the 0s become 8s, and after the last 2, they become 1s. But in the output, the positions 4-6 (0s) become 8s. So maybe the 8s are the 0s that are adjacent to 2s but part of a horizontal line. Like, if there's a stretch of 0s between two 2s, those 0s become 8s.\n\nWait, but in the input of Example 2's first row, the 2s are at positions 3 and 7, with 0s in between. In the output, those 0s (positions 4-6) become 8s, and the 0s after position 7 (the second 2) become 1s. So perhaps whenever a 2 is followed by 0s and another 2, the 0s between them become 8s. Then, any 0s after the last 2 in the row become 1s. Additionally, if there's a 0 before the first 2 in the row, it becomes 8.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. For each row, identify all positions with 2s.\n\n2. Between consecutive 2s in the row, replace any 0s with 8s.\n\n3. After the last 2 in the row, replace any 0s with 1s.\n\n4. Before the first 2 in the row, replace the 0 immediately before it with 8. Or maybe all 0s before the first 2 become 8s?\n\nWait in Example 0's first input row: the first 2 is at position 1. The 0 before it is position 0, which becomes 8. Then the next 2 is at position 6. Between positions 1 and 6, the 0s remain 0 in the output. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed at the start and end of a horizontal line of 2s. But in Example 0, the first row has two 2s not connected. So perhaps each isolated 2 is considered a line, and the adjacent 0s become 8s. But that's not matching.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output: The first few rows have 2s at certain positions, and the output replaces some 0s after the 2 with 1s. For example, in row 5 of Example 3's input, after the 2 at position 12, the 0s become 1s. Also, in row 0, the 2s are at position 3 and 12. The output changes the 0s after position 12 to 8s. Wait, the output for row 0 in Example 3's input is [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,8]. So after the last 2 (position 12), the 0s become 8s. But in other rows, after the last 2, they become 1s. So why the difference here?\n\nHmm, maybe the key is whether there's another 2 after that. But in Example 3's first row, there's a 2 at position 3 and 12. The 0s after 12 (positions 13-15) are turned into 8s. But in another example, like Example 1's first row, the 0s after the last 2 are turned into 8s. Wait, in Example 1's first input row, the 2 is at position 4, and the rest are 0s. The output changes those 0s to 8s. But in Example 3's output row 0, the 0s after the last 2 (position 12) become 8s. So perhaps, when there's only a single 2 in the row, the 0s after it are turned into 8s, and when there are multiple 2s, the 0s after the last 2 are turned into 1s. But that doesn't hold in Example 0, where there are two 2s and the 0s after the last 2 become 0s in the output. Wait, no, in Example 0's first input row, the output for the first row is [8,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So after the last 2 (position 6), the 0s remain 0. So this contradicts the earlier idea.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another approach. Let's compare the input and output row by row for each example to see the transformation.\n\nTaking Example 0's first input row:\n\nInput: [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [8,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the first 0 becomes 8. The rest remain the same except for the last row of the input, which in output becomes 8 in the last element. Wait, no. The last row of the input (row 8) is [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0], output is [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,8]. So the last 0 becomes 8. So maybe the first 0 before the first 2 and the last 0 after the last 2 in the row become 8s. But in the first row, the first 0 before the first 2 is changed to 8. The last 0 after the last 2 is position 12 (since the last 2 is at position 6). But in the output, position 12 is 0, not 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first and last occurrence of 0 in the row that are adjacent to a 2. For example, in the first row of Example 0, the first 0 is adjacent to 2 (since the next element is 2). So it's replaced with 8. The last 0 after the last 2 (position 6) would be position 7, but that's 0 in the output. So that's not changed. Hmm.\n\nLooking at another example: Example 1's first input row is [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output is [0,0,0,0,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. So all the 0s after the 2 are turned into 8s. Then, in subsequent rows, the 0s after the 2 become 1s. So maybe the first row where a 2 appears has the following 0s turned into 8s, and other rows have them turned into 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are the endpoints of the 2s' \"structure\". For example, in a horizontal line of 2s, the ends are marked with 8s. But in Example 0's first row, there are two separate 2s (positions 1 and 6). The output changes the 0 before the first 2 to 8 and the 0 after the last 2 to 8 (but in that case, the last 2 is at position 6, and the next elements are 0s, but they aren't changed to 8s in that row. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a row has a single 2, the 0s before and after are turned into 8s. But in Example 1's first row, there's a single 2 followed by 0s turned into 8s. But there are no 0s before the 2 in that row (they are already 0s before, but they remain 0s in the output). So that's not it.\n\nLooking at the 1s: In all examples, the 1s appear in the rows after certain points. For instance, in Example 0, starting from row 10, all 0s after the first 2 in the row are turned into 1s. So maybe the rule is that in a row, after the first occurrence of a 2, all 0s are turned into 1s. Except for certain positions where they are turned into 8s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions become 8s. Let's check Example 0's row 8 input: [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]. Output is [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,8]. So the last 0 in the row is turned into 8. So perhaps whenever there's a 2 followed by 0s until the end of the row, those 0s become 8s. But in Example 1's first input row, after the 2, all 0s become 8s, but in other rows, like Example 0's row 8, after the last 2 (position 11), the 0 becomes 8. So maybe the 8s are replacing the 0s that are at the end of the row, after the last 2.\n\nSo perhaps the rules are:\n\n1. For each row, after the last occurrence of 2, any trailing 0s are converted to 8s.\n\n2. Additionally, for any 0s that are in between two 2s in the row, convert them to 8s.\n\n3. Then, for all other 0s that come after the first 2 in the row, convert them to 1s.\n\nWait, let's test this with Example 2's first input row:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing step 1: After last 2 (position 7), trailing 0s become 8s? But in the output, those 0s become 1s. Wait no. The output is [0,0,0,2,8,8,8,2,1,1,...]. So between the two 2s (positions 3 and 7), the 0s become 8s. The trailing 0s after position 7 become 1s. So step 1 would be to check between 2s and replace 0s with 8s. Then, after the last 2, replace 0s with 1s. Also, if there's a 2 followed by 0s and no other 2s after, replace those 0s with 8s. But in Example 1's first row, after the 2 (position 4), all 0s are replaced with 8s. So maybe when there's only one 2 in the row, the trailing 0s after the 2 become 8s, and when there are multiple 2s, the trailing 0s after the last 2 become 1s, and the 0s between 2s become 8s.\n\nSo possible rules:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- Find all positions of 2.\n\n- If there are no 2s, leave as is.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - If there are multiple 2s, between consecutive 2s, replace 0s with 8s.\n\n   - After the last 2 in the row, replace 0s with 1s.\n\n   - Before the first 2 in the row, replace the first 0 with 8 (maybe all 0s before first 2 are 8s? Or just the first 0?)\n\nWait, in Example 0's first row, the first 0 before the first 2 is replaced with 8, but others before the first 2 are 0. But there's only one 0 before the first 2. So maybe the first 0 before the first 2 is replaced with 8. But in Example 3's first row, the input is [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]. The output is [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,8]. So before the first 2 (position 3), there are three 0s. But in the output, those remain 0. So the first 0 before the first 2 is not replaced. So this contradicts the earlier idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are only added when the 2 is at the start or end of a row. For example, if the first element of a row is a 2, then the preceding 0 (if any) would be replaced with 8. But in Example 0's first row, the 2 is in position 1 (second element), and the preceding 0 is replaced with 8. But in Example 3's first row, the first 2 is at position 3, and the preceding 0s are not replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the 8s in the outputs, they seem to appear in positions that are adjacent to the 2s in the input. For example, in Example 0's row 0, the 8 is at position 0, which is adjacent to the 2 at position 1. In row 8 of Example 0's input, the last element is 0, adjacent to the 2 at position 11, so it becomes 8. So perhaps the rule is that any 0 adjacent to a 2 (horizontally) becomes 8. But then why in Example 0's row 0, the 0s between the two 2s (positions 2-5) are 0s in the output. Because those 0s are adjacent to 2s on both sides. Hmm, but they are adjacent to 2s on the left and right. But they are not replaced with 8s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 8s are placed at the ends of a sequence of 2s. For example, if there's a single 2, the 0s to the left and right become 8s. If there's a block of 2s, then the ends of the block have 8s. But in the examples, there are rows with single 2s where the trailing 0s become 8s. Like Example 1's first row. But then, in that case, the 0 after the 2 becomes 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the first and last 0s that are adjacent to 2s in each row. For example, in a row, the first 0 that is adjacent to a 2 (left or right) is replaced with 8, and the last 0 adjacent to a 2 is replaced with 8. All other 0s after the first 2 are replaced with 1s. But how to determine adjacency.\n\nThis is getting a bit too vague. Let's try to see a pattern with the 8s and 1s.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: 8,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,... \n\nRow 8: 0,2,...,2,8 \n\nRow 10 and onwards: 0,0,2,1,1,1,1,...\n\nIn the rows starting from 10, the 0s after the 2 are all 1s. So the pattern here is that after the first occurrence of a 2 in a row, all 0s are turned into 1s, except for certain positions where they become 8s. The 8s seem to appear at the start and end of certain paths. For example, in rows that are part of a vertical structure, like the first row's first 0 becomes 8, which could be the top of a structure, and the last row's last 0 becomes 8, which is the bottom.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed at the corners of the 2s' structure. But without seeing the actual arrangement, it's hard to say. Since the input and output are lists, perhaps each list represents a row in a grid, and the transformation is based on that grid's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 1s are part of a numbering system, where 8 represents the start or end of a sequence, and 1s are filling the space after.\n\nLet me look at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]\n[2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nWe need to transform this based on the pattern from training examples.\n\nLooking at the first two rows of the test input: each has a 2 at position 10. So following the pattern from Example 1's first row, perhaps the 0s after the 2 in these rows become 8s. But in Example 1's first row, the 0s after the 2 become 8s. So maybe for these rows, the output would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,8,8,8] for the first two rows.\n\nThe third row of the test input is all 2s except the last four elements. The output would likely have the 0s after the 2s turned into 1s. But since the 2s are contiguous until position 10, the 0s after that would become 1s. So [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow 4 of the test input: the 2 is at position 10, followed by more 2s. So after the last 2 (position 15), there are no 0s. So this row would remain as is.\n\nRow 5-8: each has a 2 at position 10. So the 0s after would become 1s. So [0,...,0,2,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow 9: all 2s. No changes.\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]. Here, there are 2s at positions 3, 10, and 12. Between 3 and 10 are 0s. Between 10 and 12 are 0s. According to Example 2's pattern, the 0s between consecutive 2s become 8s. So between 3 and 10: 0s become 8s. Between 10 and 12: 0 becomes 8. So row 10 output would be [0,0,0,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,0,0,0]. Then, after the last 2 (position 12), the 0s would become 1s. But in this case, after 12, there are 0s. But since there's another 2 at 12, maybe the trailing 0s after 12 would become 1s. So [0,0,0,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,1,1,1]. Wait, but in Example 2, between two 2s, 0s are 8s, and after the last 2, they become 1s. So in row 10 of the test input, after the last 2 (position 12), the 0s are positions 13-15. So those would become 1s. But in the test input's row 10, there's a 2 at position 12, followed by 0s. So the output would have those 0s as 1s. But also, between the 2s at positions 10 and 12, there's a 0 at position 11. That would be replaced with 8. Similarly, between positions 3 and 10, there are 0s that become 8s. So row 10's output would be [0,0,0,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,1,1,1].\n\nBut in the training examples, when there are multiple 2s in a row, the 0s between them become 8s, and after the last 2, 0s become 1s. So this seems to fit.\n\nRow 11 of the test input: [2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]. The 2s are at positions 0-3, then 10, 12. Between 3 and 10, there are 0s. Those would become 8s. Between 10 and 12: 0 becomes 8. After 12: 0s become 1s. So row 11's output would be [2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,1,1,1].\n\nRow 12: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]. Same as row 10. So output would be same as row 10's output.\n\nPutting this all together, the test output would look like:\n\nFor rows 0 and 1: 0s after the 2 at position 10 become 8s.\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: all 2s followed by 0s. The 0s after the last 2 (position 10) become 1s: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 3: 2 at position 10. 0s after become 1s: [0,...,0,2,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 4: 2s from 10 to 15. No 0s after, so remains as is.\n\nRows 5-8: 2 at position 10. 0s after become 1s: each row would end with 1s starting from position 11.\n\nRow 9: all 2s, no change.\n\nRows 10-12: as discussed, with 8s between 2s and 1s after last 2.\n\nBut wait, looking back at Example 3's output, when there are multiple 2s in a row, like in row 0 of Example 3, the 0s after the last 2 become 8s. But in Example 0, between two 2s, the 0s are left as 0s. Hmm, this is conflicting. Maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are only between the first and last 2 in the row, and after the last 2, 0s become 1s. So, in any row with at least one 2:\n\n- All 0s between the first and last 2 in the row are replaced with 8s.\n\n- All 0s after the last 2 are replaced with 1s.\n\n- 0s before the first 2 are left as 0s.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0's first row: first 2 at position 1, last 2 at position 6. The 0s between them (positions 2-5) become 8s? But in the output, they remain 0s. So this contradicts.\n\nExample 2's first row: first 2 at 3, last at 7. 0s between (4-6) become 8s. Yes, which matches. The output after 7 becomes 1s. So this fits.\n\nExample 3's first row: first 2 at 3, last at 12. The 0s between 3 and 12 are replaced with 8s? But in the output, they're 0s. Wait, no. The output is [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,8]. So between the first and last 2 (positions 3 and 12), the 0s are not replaced. So this rule doesn't hold.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Another approach: perhaps the 8s are placed at the positions where a 2 is present in the row below or above. Like in a grid, if a 0 is adjacent vertically to a 2, it becomes 8. But without seeing the grid layout, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s and 1s could represent a count. For example, 8 represents the count of 2s in the column up to that row. But I don't think so.\n\nAnother observation: in all training examples, the 8s appear only in certain rows, usually the first or last occurrences of a 2 in their column. For instance, in Example 0's row 0, the 8 is the first element, which is the first occurrence of a 2 in that column. Similarly, the last row's 8 is the last occurrence. So perhaps the 8s mark the first and last occurrence of a 2 in their respective columns, and the 1s fill the rest.\n\nBut how to determine that. Let's take Example 0:\n\nThe first column has a 2 in row 1 (input row 0 is [0,2,0...], output row 0 becomes 8. Then in column 0, the first 2 is in row 1 (input row 0's first element is 0, output row 0's first element is 8). So that's the first occurrence in column 0. Wait, but the output row 0's first element is 8. But in the input, row 1 has a 2 in column 0. So perhaps the 8 is marking the first occurrence in the column.\n\nBut then in Example 0's output row 8, the last element is 8. In the input, that column (column 12) has a 2 in row 8. So that would be the last occurrence in that column. So the 8s are marking the first and last occurrence in each column. The 1s are the occurrences in between.\n\nBut how does this fit with the input and output transformations.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each column:\n\n- The first occurrence of a 2 in the column is replaced with 8.\n\n- The last occurrence is replaced with 8.\n\n- All other 2s in between are left as 2s.\n\n- The 0s that are between the first and last 8s are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut this doesn't directly align with the examples. For example, in Example 0's column 1, there are multiple 2s. The first occurrence is row 0 (input row 0, column 1 is 2), but in the output, it's still 2. The first 8 is in row 0, column 0, which is not a 2 in the input.\n\nSo this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 0s that are adjacent to 2s in the same row, but only at the start and end of the row. Like, the first 0 before the first 2 in the row and the first 0 after the last 2 in the row are replaced with 8s, and all other 0s after the first 2 are 1s.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0's first row:\n\nInput: [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nFirst 0 before first 2 is position 0: becomes 8.\n\nFirst 0 after last 2 (position 6) is position 7: becomes 8? But in the output, position 7 is 0. So no.\n\nBut in Example 1's first row:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nFirst 0 before first 2 is position 4. The output's first 0 after the 2 is replaced with 8s. So all 0s after the 2 (positions 5-12) become 8s.\n\nBut according to this rule, the first 0 after the last 2 (which is the same as the first 2 in this case) should be replaced with 8. So all 0s after the 2 become 8s. Then, other rows in the same example have 0s after the 2 replaced with 1s. So maybe the first row where a 2 appears in a column has the 0s after replaced with 8s, and subsequent rows with 2 in the same column have 0s replaced with 1s. \n\nAlternatively, the first row in the entire input that has a 2 in a certain column has the 0s around it turned into 8s, and subsequent rows with 2s in that column have 0s turned into 1s. This might explain why in Example 0's row 0, the first 0 is 8 (first occurrence in that column), and in other rows, the same column's 0s are 1s.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach based on the examples:\n\n- For each row, after the last occurrence of 2, replace all 0s with 1s.\n\n- Between consecutive 2s in a row, replace 0s with 8s.\n\n- Additionally, replace the first 0 before the first 2 in the row with 8, and the first 0 after the last 2 in the row with 8.\n\nBut applying this to the test input.\n\nFor the test input's first row:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe first 0 before the first 2 (position 10) is at position 0. But according to Example 1, the 0s after the 2 become 8s. So the output would be [0,...,0,2,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nThen, rows 0 and 1 of the test input would have 0s after the 2 replaced with 8s.\n\nRow 2: [2,2,...,2,0,0,0,0,0]. The last 2 is at position 10. The 0s after become 1s.\n\nRow 3: [0,...,0,2,0,...]. After the 2, 0s become 1s.\n\nRow 4: ends with 2s, so no change.\n\nRows 5-8: 0s after 2 become 1s.\n\nRow 9: all 2s.\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,2,0,...,2,0,2,0...]. Between the 2s at 3 and 10: 0s become 8s.
