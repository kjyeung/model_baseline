        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of numbers, and the output is another list, but shorter. Let's see what's common between the input and output in each example.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has multiple arrays, and the output is five elements. Let me look at the first input array in Example 0:\n\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nThe output is [0,3,3,3,3]. Wait, the first five elements of the input array are 0,3,3,3,3. But the output here is exactly those first five. But wait, looking at the other outputs in Example 0, maybe not. Let me check another input array.\n\nLooking at the second input array in Example 0:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,3]\n\nThe output here is [0,3,3,3,3]. Wait, but the first five elements of this input array are 3,3,3,3,3. So that doesn't match. So maybe it's not the first five elements.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the middle part of the input array. Let me check the positions. The input arrays are 24 elements long, and the output is 5 elements. Let's see. For Example 0, the first input array's output is [0,3,3,3,3]. Let me check where these elements appear in the input array. The input starts with 0,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,... So the first five elements are exactly the output. But then the second input array's output is [0,3,3,3,3], but the input starts with 3,3,3,3,3. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different pattern. Let me look at all the input arrays in Example 0. Each input array is part of a larger structure. The outputs in Example 0 are five elements each. Let me check if the output is related to a certain position in the input array. For instance, maybe the elements around the middle?\n\nWait, 24 elements. The middle would be around position 12. Let's see. For the first input array in Example 0, the elements around position 12 are ...0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking every fifth element or something. Alternatively, maybe it's the fifth element from the end. Let's see. The first output is [0,3,3,3,3]. The first input array's elements from the end: the last five are 1,1,1,1,1,0. But output starts with 0. So maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a slice of the input array. Let's check the first input in Example 0:\n\nOriginal input array length 24. Output is 5 elements. If we split the input into parts. For example, maybe each input is split into segments, and the output picks certain elements. Alternatively, maybe the output is the maximum value in certain positions. Wait, in Example 0, the output has elements 0,3,3,3,3. The input starts with 0,3,3,3,3. So maybe the first five elements. But in the second input array of Example 0, the output is [0,3,3,3,3], but the input starts with [3,3,3,3,3]. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the first example's output, the output is [6,6,6,6,6], and the input arrays have 8s and 3s but the output is 6s. So maybe the output is related to the middle part of the input arrays. Let's check the input arrays in Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh input array is [0,8,8,0,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,0,8,8,0]. The output here is part of the examples where the output is [6,6,6,6,6]. So the middle part here is the 6s. So in the seventh input array, the sixth element is 6, followed by 6s. So maybe the output is taking the elements starting from position 6, taking the next five elements? Let's check:\n\nFor the seventh input array in Example 1, elements 6 to 10 (assuming 0-based index) are 6,6,6,6,6. That would match the output [6,6,6,6,6]. But let's check another input array in Example 1.\n\nTake the second input array in Example 1:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThe output is [6,6,0,6,6]. Wait, but there are no 6s in this input array. So that can't be. So perhaps that approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from a specific position in the input arrays. For example, maybe the output is the elements from the middle of the array. Let's see. For the first example's first output [6,6,6,6,6], looking at the input array that corresponds to that output, maybe the 6s are in positions 6 to 10 (elements 6-10 inclusive). For example, the seventh input array in Example 1 has elements starting at position 6 as 6,6,6,6,6,6,... So positions 6-10 would be 6,6,6,6,6. That's five elements, matching the output. Then the output would be elements 6-10. Let's check another example.\n\nTake the second example's input arrays. For Example 2, the output is [0,5,5,0,5]. Let's look at the seventh input array in Example 2:\n\n[5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,5]\n\nIf the output is elements 6-10 (positions 6 to 10), then elements at indices 6-10 are 0,5,0,0,5. So the output would be [0,5,0,0,5], but the actual output is [0,5,5,0,5]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is elements 6-10 in the input array. Wait in Example 0, first input array's elements 6-10 are 0,2,2,2,0. But the output is [0,3,3,3,3]. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the pattern.\n\nLooking back at the examples, perhaps each input is a circular arrangement, and the output is a certain part of it. Alternatively, maybe the input is a grid (like 2D array) and the output is a row or column. For example, if each input array is arranged into a 6x4 grid (but 6*4=24). Wait, 24 elements. Maybe 6 rows of 4 elements each? But then how would that map to a 5-element output? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is arranged in a circular pattern, and the output is the center part. Alternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking every fourth element. Let me check.\n\nFor Example 0's first input array: [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. Taking every fourth element starting at 0: 0 (index 0), 3 (index4), 0 (index8), 0 (index12), 2 (index16), 1 (index20). That gives [0,3,0,0,2,1], which doesn't match the output. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first five elements of the input array. But in Example 0's first input, the output is [0,3,3,3,3], which matches the first five elements. But the second input in Example 0 has first five elements [3,3,3,3,3], but the output is [0,3,3,3,3], which doesn't match. So that can't be.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the output in the input arrays. For Example 0, all the outputs are of length 5. Let's see if the output sequences appear in the input arrays. For the first output [0,3,3,3,3], looking at the first input array, this sequence is indeed the first five elements. But in the second input array of Example 0, the output is [0,3,3,3,3], but the second input array starts with [3,3,3,3,3]. So where does [0,3,3,3,3] come from in that input array? Let's check the second input array:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,3]\n\nLooking for the sequence 0,3,3,3,3. There is a 0 at index5, followed by 2,2,0, etc. So no. So maybe not a direct sequence.\n\nLooking at the test input now. The test input arrays start with 4s, 0s, and then 3s, etc. The outputs in the training examples seem to relate to a certain value. For example, in Example 0, the outputs are 3s and 0s. In Example 1, the outputs are 6s and 0s. In Example 2, they are 5s and 0s.\n\nWait, looking at the test input's later arrays, there's a part with 8s and 1s. For example, the seventh array in the test input is [0,3,3,3,0,0,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,0,0,3,3,3,0]. So elements 6-10 here are 8,8,8,1,1. But the output in Example 1 for similar structures was 6s, but here maybe the output would be 1s? But how does that fit with the pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the middle value of the input array. For example, if the input array is symmetric, the middle elements could form the output. Let's see. For Example 0's first input array, the middle elements (assuming 24 elements) would be around positions 11-13. But that might not fit.\n\nWait, perhaps each input array is a combination of multiple layers, and the output is the top layer or a specific part. Alternatively, the output could be the fifth element from each row if arranged as a grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are in positions where a certain condition is met. For instance, the maximum value in the array, but in Example 0, the output has 3s and 0s, but there are higher numbers like 3s, 2s, 1s. Wait, the first input array in Example 0 has 0,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,... So the maximum is 3, and the output is 3s. But in the output, the first element is 0. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother thought: in each training example, the output is five elements. The input arrays are 24 elements. 24 divided by 5 is 4.8, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the outputs are derived by taking the first occurrence of each unique number in the input array. But Example 0's first input array has 0,3,2,1. The output is [0,3,3,3,3]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, looking at the first example's output: all 6s except one line. The input arrays in Example 1 have a section with 6s. For instance, the seventh input array has a run of 6s starting at position 6. The output for that example is [6,6,6,6,6]. Similarly, other input arrays in Example 1 have runs of 6s. Maybe the output is the first five elements of the longest consecutive sequence in the input array. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's seventh input array: the 6s run from index 6 to 17 (12 elements), so the first five would be six 6s. That matches the output [6,6,6,6,6].\n\nAnother input in Example 1: the second input array is [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]. The longest run here is 3s (six at the start and end) or 8s (from index6 to 8: 8,8,8, then 0, but then again 8s. So the longest consecutive run of a single number may be the 8s from index6 to 17: 8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8. But that's interrupted by 0s, so not a consecutive run. So perhaps the longest consecutive run is the 3s at the start (six 3s). But the output in Example 1's second input array's output is [6,6,0,6,6], which doesn't align. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first five elements of the input array that are followed by a 0. For example, in Example 0's first input array, the first elements are 0,3,3,3,3. The next element is 0, which is a 0. So maybe that's the trigger. The output takes elements until a 0 is encountered. But in the first example, the output is all 6s, which are followed by more 6s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at how many outputs there are per example. In Example 0, there are 5 output arrays, each of 5 elements. The input has 24 arrays, but the output has 5. Wait, wait, looking back, each example's input is a list of multiple arrays. For example, in Example 0, the INPUT is a list of 24 arrays (each being a list of 24 numbers?), but the output is 5 arrays. Wait, no, looking at the formatting:\n\nWait, the input for each example is a series of arrays. For example, Example 0's input has multiple arrays (each line inside the INPUT block is an array). Let me count them. Example 0's INPUT lists 24 arrays (each line is an array). The output is 5 arrays. So the number of output arrays is less than the input. So perhaps each output array is derived from a subset of the input arrays. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the input arrays are arranged in a certain way, like layers, and the output is the central part. But I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, let's think of each input array as a circular structure, maybe a ring. For example, if each array represents concentric rings, the output might be the central ring. For example, a 5x5 grid with rings, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, perhaps each input array is a flattened 2D structure, and the output is the middle row or column. For example, a 24-element array could be a 6x4 grid. Taking the middle row would be 4 elements, but the output is 5 elements, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the input arrays are split into groups of 5, and the output is one group. But 24 divided into groups of 5 would give 4 full groups (20 elements) and 4 left. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the five elements starting from the middle of the input array. For a 24-element array, the middle would be between elements 11 and 12. Taking elements 10-14 (indices 10 to 14 inclusive) would be five elements. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's first input array, elements 10-14 are 0,0,0,0,2. The output is [0,3,3,3,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, looking at the test input's input arrays. Let's take the first array:\n\n[4,4,4,0,4,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,4,4,4]\n\nIf I look for a pattern where the output is the elements starting from index 6 to 10. Index 6 is 0, then 3,3,3,0. That would be [0,3,3,3,0]. But in the training examples, the outputs for Example 0 and 1 have varying patterns. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the numbers that appear in the center of the input arrays. For example, in Example 0's first input array, the middle elements might be part of a pattern. Let's think of the input array as arranged in a circle. For example, if the array is a circular buffer, maybe the output is a segment. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs in Example 0 are all 5-element arrays starting with 0 or 3. The inputs have 3s, 2s, 1s, and 0s. The outputs seem to be the first part of the input arrays. Wait, the first output in Example 0 is [0,3,3,3,3], which matches the first five elements of the first input array. The second output in Example 0 is [0,3,3,3,3], but the second input array starts with [3,3,3,3,3]. So that doesn't fit. But maybe the output is from a different position in the input array.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the outputs are all 6s except one line. The sixth input array in Example 1's INPUT is [0,8,8,0,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,0,8,8,0]. The first five elements are [0,8,8,0,8], but the output is [6,6,6,6,6], which is elements 6-10. So maybe the output is the elements starting at index 6 for five elements. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's second input array: [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]. Elements 6-10 are 8,8,8,0,8. The output for this example is [6,6,0,6,6]. Wait, but those elements are 8,8,8,0,8, which doesn't match the output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is elements 6-10 of the input array where a certain value is present. For example, in Example 1's seventh input array, elements 6-10 are 6,6,6,6,6, which matches the output. But in other input arrays, like the second input array, the elements 6-10 are 8,8,8,0,8, which doesn't match the output. So perhaps this isn't the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the output corresponds to the first occurrence of a new number in the input array. For example, in Example 0's first input array, the numbers start with 0, then switch to 3, then to 0 again, then to 2, etc. The output is [0,3,3,3,3], which captures the initial 0 followed by four 3s. But in other examples, this doesn't hold. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the first five elements after the first occurrence of a certain number. For example, in Example 1, the output is 6s, which appear after the initial numbers. But how to determine which number triggers the start.\n\nLooking at the test input, the seventh array in the test input starts with 0,3,3,3,0,0,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,... The output here might relate to the 1s. The elements 9-13 are 1,1,1,1,1, which could be the output. If the output is five elements of 1,1,1,1,1. But in the training example 2, the outputs include 5s and 0s. So maybe the output is the first occurrence of five consecutive same numbers. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input array, there are four 3s followed by a 0. So no five in a row. But the output is [0,3,3,3,3]. Not five same numbers. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the seventh input array has six 6s in a row. The output is five 6s. So maybe the first five of such a sequence. That would fit. But in Example 0's first input array, the output isn't a sequence of same numbers. So maybe this isn't the pattern.\n\nAnother angle: the output corresponds to the numbers in a certain position across all input arrays. For example, each output array is made up of the fifth element from each input array. But in Example 0, there are 24 input arrays, but the output has 5 arrays. So maybe each output array is a combination of certain elements from the input arrays.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array is derived from one input array. For example, in Example 0, there are 24 input arrays and 5 output arrays. So each output array might correspond to a subset of input arrays. But it's unclear which subset.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are the first five input arrays transformed in some way. But in Example 0, the output has five arrays, and the input has 24. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the five middle arrays from the input, but again, not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for another pattern. In Example 0, each output array has five elements, which could correspond to the five distinct sections in the input arrays. For example, maybe the input array is divided into five parts, and the output is the first element of each part. Let's see:\n\nFor Example 0's first input array, length 24. Divided into five parts would be roughly 5 parts of 5 elements each (but 5x5=25, which is more than 24). Maybe not. Alternatively, each output element is the sum of certain elements in the input array. But Example 0's output has 0,3,3,3,3. Summing doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a compression of the input array. For example, each group of four elements in the input is summed or averaged to produce one element in the output. 24 elements divided by 5 output elements is not a whole number. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the unique elements in the input array, but limited to five. But in Example 0's first input array, the unique elements are 0,3,2,1. Which is four elements. But the output has five elements. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of each number in the input array. But again, not matching.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the test input, the first few arrays have 4s and 0s, then 3s, then later arrays have 8s and 1s. Maybe the output is related to the numbers that appear in the middle of the input arrays. For example, the seventh array in the test input has a sequence of 1s. The output might be those 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first five elements after the first occurrence of the maximum number in the input array. For example, in Example 0's first input array, the maximum is 3. The first occurrence is at index 1. The next five elements are 3,3,3,3,0. But the output is [0,3,3,3,3], which is before the first 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first five elements of the input array after reversing it. For Example 0's first input array, reversed is [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]. The first five elements are 0,1,1,1,1. Not matching the output.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the first five elements after the first occurrence of 0. For Example 0's first input array, the first element is 0. Then the next five are 3,3,3,3,0. So output [3,3,3,3,0]. But the actual output is [0,3,3,3,3]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the last five elements of the input array. For Example 0's first input array, the last five elements are 1,1,1,1,0. Not matching the output.\n\nAnother angle: the output arrays in the training examples all have elements that are present in the input arrays. For example, Example 0's output has 0 and 3. Example 1's output has 6 and 0. Example 2's output has 5 and 0. So the output elements are among the input elements. But how to determine which ones.\n\nIn the test input, the arrays include 4,0,3,8,1. So perhaps the output will be 1s, 8s, or something else.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, in Example 1, the outputs are all 6s except one line with a 0. The input arrays in Example 1 have a section with 6s. So maybe the output is related to the first occurrence of a sequence of 6s. In the seventh input array of Example 1, there's a long sequence of 6s, and the output is five 6s. Similarly, other input arrays with 6s might contribute to the output.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output arrays include 5s and 0s, and the input arrays have a section with 1s. The outputs in Example 2's test case are [0,5,5,0,5], etc. So maybe the output is related to the first occurrence of a certain number in the input arrays.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in each example, the output seems to be a specific pattern related to the middle of the input. For instance, in Example 0, the first output is [0,3,3,3,3], which could correspond to the first part of the input array. The third output in Example 0 is [3,0,0,3,3], which might be from a different part.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern here. Let me try to look for another approach.\n\nAnother possibility: the input arrays are arranged in a way that represents multiple layers or transformations, and the output is the first layer. For example, each input array could be a combination of multiple layers, and the output is the top layer. But without more context, this is hard to verify.\n\nAlternatively, the input arrays are part of a cellular automaton or similar pattern, and the output is the next step. But the output is shorter than the input, which complicates things.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput arrays are 24 elements each, and the output arrays are 5 elements. Maybe the output is the first five elements after some transformation. For instance, maybe summing every consecutive elements. For example, the first output element is the sum of the first four elements, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the difference between consecutive elements. For Example 0's first input array: 0,3,3,3,3. The differences are 3,0,0,0. Doesn't match the output.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the five elements that form a palindrome or some symmetry. For example, in Example 0's first output [0,3,3,3,3], it's a palindrome if we ignore the first 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the most frequent number in the input array. For Example 0's first input array, 3 appears 8 times, which is the most frequent. The output starts with 0, which is less frequent. So that's not it.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that each output array is the first five non-zero elements of the input array. For Example 0's first input array, the first five non-zero elements are 3,3,3,3. But the output starts with 0, so that's not matching.\n\nAnother approach: the output arrays in the training examples have lengths of 5 elements each, and each example's output has five arrays. The input for each example has multiple arrays. For instance, Example 0's input has 24 arrays, output has 5. So maybe each output array corresponds to a specific input array. For example, the first output array corresponds to the first input array, but in Example 0, the first input array's first five elements are [0,3,3,3,3], which matches the first output array. The second output array is [0,3,3,3,3], which would correspond to the second input array's first five elements [3,3,3,3,3]. But that's not matching. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, each output array is formed by taking the first element of each of five input arrays. For example, in Example 0's input, there are 24 input arrays, and the output has five. So the first output array could be the first elements of the first five input arrays. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first five input arrays start with 0,3,3,3,3. So the first elements are 0,3,3,3,3. Which matches the first output array [0,3,3,3,3]. The second output array is [0,3,3,3,3]. The second input array starts with 3,3,3,3,3. So the first element is 3. But the output starts with 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nIn Example 0, the outputs are:\n\n[0,3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0,3]\n\nLooking at these, maybe they form a pattern of their own. The first two are the same, then the next two change. Perhaps the output is a transformation of the input arrays in a way that each output array is a rotation or mirror of the previous.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the test input's arrays include elements like 8,3,1,4, etc., maybe the output is related to the last part of the input arrays. For example, the test input's seventh array has a sequence of 1s. Maybe the output is the five 1s.\n\nLooking at Example 1's outputs, where the input arrays have 6s, the output is mostly 6s. Similarly, Example 2's outputs have 5s and 0s, where the input arrays have 5s. So perhaps the output is the first occurrence of a sequence of a certain number, which in the test input's case would be the 1s in the seventh array.\n\nIn the test input, looking at the seventh array:\n\n[0,3,3,3,0,0,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,0,0,3,3,3,0]\n\nThe elements from index 9 to 13 are 1,1,1,1,1. So if the output is these five 1s, then the corresponding output would be [1,1,1,1,1]. But I need to check if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh input array has a run of 6s starting at index6. The output is [6,6,6,6,6], which matches the first five of that run. Similarly, in Example 2's input arrays, the sixteenth array has a run of 1s, and the output includes those 1s.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is: for each input array, identify the longest consecutive run of a single number, and take the first five elements of that run. If there's a tie, take the first occurrence. If no run of five or more, take whatever is available.\n\nBut in Example 0's first input array, the longest run is the four 3s. So how does that output [0,3,3,3,3] fit? The run of 3s is four elements, but the output has five elements. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first five elements of the input array where the same number appears consecutively. For instance, in Example 0's first input array, after the initial 0, there are four 3s. So the output is the 0 followed by four 3s. But that gives five elements.\n\nBut in Example 0's second input array, the run starts with five 3s. The output is [0,3,3,3,3]. Which doesn't match. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is the first five elements of the input array, but with the numbers replaced by the count of their consecutive occurrences. For example, in Example 0's first input array, the first five elements are [0,3,3,3,3]. The counts would be 1 for 0, 4 for 3s. But the output is [0,3,3,3,3], not the counts. So no.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's think about the test input again. The seventh array in the test input has 1s in positions 9-13. The output for that array would likely be [1,1,1,1,1]. But how does this relate to the training examples?\n\nIn Example 2's sixteenth input array:\n\n[5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5]\n\nThe run of 1s is at positions 10-14 (1,1,1,1,1). The output for this example includes [5,5,5,5,0], which doesn't match. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the positions of the outputs in the input arrays. For Example 0's outputs, the first output is [0,3,3,3,3], which is the first five elements of the first input array. The second output is the same, which would match the second input array's first five elements if they were [0,3,3,3,3], but the second input array's first five are [3,3,3,3,3]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first five elements of the input array but with some transformation. For example, replacing each element with the previous element. Or rotating the array.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the input arrays might represent different layers or rows of a larger structure, and the output is a specific row. For example, if each input array is a row in a 24-row structure, the output is the middle five rows' first elements. But this is too vague.\n\nAfter trying multiple approaches and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the test input. Since the seventh input array in the test case has five consecutive 1s (elements 9-13), and in similar training examples (like Example 1), the output was the consecutive numbers, I'll assume the output for the test case's seventh array is [1,1,1,1,1]. But looking at the training examples, Example 1's outputs included a line with [6,0,0,6,0], which might suggest that not all outputs are full sequences. \n\nAlternatively, the output might be related to the minimal or maximal values in the input arrays. But in Example 0, the output includes 0 and 3, which are present in the input. \n\nAnother observation: in each training example, the output's length matches the number of output arrays. For example, in Example 0, there are 5 output arrays, each with 5 elements. Maybe each output array corresponds to a specific position in each of the input arrays. For example, the first output array is composed of the first element of each input array. But in Example 0, there are 24 input arrays and 5 output arrays, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are the first five input arrays after some transformation. For example, in Example 0, the first five input arrays transformed into the first five output arrays. But in Example 0, the first input array's output is [0,3,3,3,3], which is the first five elements. The second input array's first five elements are [3,3,3,3,3], but the output is [0,3,3,3,3], which is different. So that's not it.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the test input's structure. The seventh array in the test input has a sequence of five 1s, which might correspond to the output. Similarly, other arrays might have similar sequences. For example, the first test input array has a sequence of 4s and 0s, but the output might be [4,4,4,0,4]. However, looking at the training examples, the output often starts with a 0. For instance, Example 0's outputs start with 0 or 3. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is the fifth through ninth elements of each input array. For example, in the test input's seventh array, elements 5-9 are 0,8,8,8,1. But the output would be [0,8,8,8,1], which doesn't seem right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements surrounding the middle of the input array. For 24 elements, the middle is between positions 11 and 12. Taking positions 9-13 gives five elements. In the test input's seventh array, positions 9-13 are 1,1,1,1,1. So the output would be [1,1,1,1,1]. This aligns with Example 1's seventh input array's output of six 6s in positions 6-10. \n\nSo, based on this, the pattern might be: take the five elements around the middle of the input array. For even-length arrays (24 elements), the middle is between 12th and 13th elements. So taking elements 10-14 (0-based indices 9 to 13) would give five elements. Let's check the training examples:\n\nExample 0's first input array:\n\nIndices 9-13: 2,0,0,0,0. The output is [0,3,3,3,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nExample 1's seventh input array:\n\nIndices 9-13: 0,8,8,0,8. But the output is [6,6,6,6,6]. Which are elements 6-10. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nAfter struggling for so long, I think the pattern must be taking elements from a specific position in each input array. Since in Example 1, the outputs are all 6s which are in positions 6-10 of the seventh input array, and the test input's seventh array has 1s in positions 9-13, maybe the output is taking elements 9-13 (five elements). For the test input's seventh array, this would be [1,1,1,1,1]. If this is the case, then each output array corresponds to elements 9-13 of each input array. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1's seventh input array: elements 9-13 are 0,8,8,0,8. But the output is [6,6,6,6,6], which are elements 6-10. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, elements 6-10. For Example 1's seventh input array, elements 6-10 are 6,6,6,6,6. Output is [6,6,6,6,6], which matches. For the second input array in Example 1, elements 6-10 are 8,8,8,0,8. But the output is [6,6,0,6,6]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is confusing. Given the time constraints, I'll assume that the pattern is to take elements 6-10 of each input array and use those as the output. For the test input's seventh array, elements 6-10 are 8,8,8,1,1, which would give [8,8,8,1,1], but the training examples don't support this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the input array's elements that are in the sixth position, but this doesn't fit.\n\nIn the absence of a clear pattern, I'll make a guess based on the test input's seventh array. The output would likely be [1,1,1,1,1] for that array, and similar patterns for others. But since the training examples have varying patterns, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each input array in the test input, take elements 9-13 (indices 9 to 13 inclusive) to form the output. This would give five elements. For the seventh array in the test input, this would be [1,1,1,1,1]. Other arrays might have different values.\n\nBut I need to check with the training examples. For Example 0's first input array, elements 9-13 are 2,0,0,0,0. The output is [0,3,3,3,3]. So this doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: in the test input, some arrays have a sequence of 3s and 0s, others have 4s. The output might be related to the first sequence of five consecutive numbers. For example, the first array in the test input is [4,4,4,0,4,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,4,4,4]. The first five elements are [4,4,4,0,4], which has four 4s. No five in a row. So the output might be this sequence. But the training examples don't confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first five elements of the input array. For the test input's first array, this would be [4,4,4,0,4]. For the seventh array, it's [0,3,3,3,0]. But in Example 0's output, this approach worked for the first input array but not others.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to proceed with the best guess. Based on the training examples, the output seems to be the first five elements of a certain part of the input array, possibly the middle. For the test input, I'll guess that the output is the five elements starting at index 6 (seventh position) for each input array. For example, in the seventh array of the test input, starting at index 6: [8,8,8,1,1], but the output for Example 1's seventh array was [6,6,6,6,6], which was the elements starting at index6. So this might make sense.\n\nBut in the test input, there are 24 input arrays. The output requires five arrays. So maybe the first five input arrays are transformed. For each of those, take elements 6-10. For the first test input array, elements 6-10 are 0,3,3,3,0. Which would be [0,3,3,3,0]. But the training examples don't show this pattern.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern is taking elements 6-10 of each input array. For Example 1's seventh array, that's 6,6,6,6,6. For the test input's seventh array, elements 6-10 are 8,8,8,1,1. But the output for Example 1's seventh array was [6,6,6,6,6], which matches elements 6-10. So perhaps this is the pattern.\n\nApplying this to the test input's first five arrays:\n\nFirst test input array: elements 6-10 are 0,3,3,3,0 \u2192 [0,3,3,3,0]\n\nSecond array: elements 6-10 are 3,3,3,3,0 \u2192 [3,3,3,3,0]\n\nThird array: elements 6-10 are 3,3,0,0,3 \u2192 [3,3,0,0,3]\n\nFourth array: elements 6-10 are 3,3,0,0,3 \u2192 [3,3,0,0,3]\n\nFifth array: elements 6-10 are 0,0,3,3,0 \u2192 [0,0,3,3,0]\n\nBut the training examples in Example 0 have outputs that don't align with this. For example, the first input array's elements 6-10 are 0,2,2,2,0. Output is [0,3,3,3,3], which doesn't match. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAfter all this, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the test input's seventh array having five 1s and the pattern in the training examples where a new number appears in the output. So the answer might be:\n\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n\nBut according to the training examples, each example's output consists of multiple arrays, so the test output should have multiple arrays. Looking at the training examples, each example's output has five arrays. So the test output should have five arrays. Each array corresponds to one of the input arrays.\n\nLooking back at the test input, there are 24 input arrays. But the output needs to be five arrays, each of five elements. The training examples have outputs with five arrays. For example, Example 0's output has five arrays. So perhaps the test output should have five arrays, each corresponding to a specific input array.\n\nGiven that, and considering the seventh array in the test input has five 1s, perhaps the output includes [1,1,1,1,1] as one of the arrays. However, the test input has multiple arrays with 8s and 1s, so it's possible the outputs are:\n\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,0,0,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,0,0,1,0]\n\nBut this is purely a guess.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the training examples, the output arrays are the first five elements of certain input arrays. For example, in Example 0, the first five input arrays' first five elements are:\n\n[0,3,3,3,3]\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n[3,3,3,0,0]\n[3,3,0,3,3]\n[3,3,0,3,3]\n\nBut the output is:\n\n[0,3,3,3,3]\n[0,3,3,3,3]\n[3,0,0,3,3]\n[3,3,3,0,3]\n[3,3,3,0,3]\n\nThis doesn't match. So perhaps the output is not directly the first five elements.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed to provide an answer based on the assumption that the output for the test input is five arrays, each corresponding to the five consecutive 1s in the seventh input array. However, since the test input has 24 arrays and the output should have five, I'm not sure which ones to pick. Alternatively, the output is the five arrays in the test input that contain the sequence of 1s. For example, the seventh to eleventh arrays in the test input have 1s in certain positions.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll have to provide a generic answer. The final answer based on the test input's seventh array (with 1s) would be:\n\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n\nBut this is a shot in the dark. Alternatively, considering the test input's seventh array's elements 9-13 are 1s, and other arrays may have similar patterns, the output could be:\n\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the examples, especially Example 1, where the output was [6,6,6,6,6], I'll proceed with this.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the training examples and determine how the input lists are transformed into the output lists, then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input has multiple lists, each 24 elements long. The output has 5-element lists. Let's see how they relate.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first input list is [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. The corresponding output is [0,3,3,3,3]. Hmm, the first five elements of the input are 0,3,3,3,3, which matches the output. But wait, the next output lists in Example 0 are [0,3,3,3,3], [3,0,0,3,3], etc. Let me check another input line. The second input line in Example 0 starts with [3,3,3,3,3,0,...], and the output is [0,3,3,3,3]. Wait, that doesn't align. So maybe it's not the first five elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking a portion from each input list. Let's look at the positions. Let's count the elements. Each input list is 24 elements. If the output is 5 elements, perhaps each output list is a specific slice from the input list.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs for Example 0:\n\nThe first output is [0,3,3,3,3]. The first input list starts with 0,3,3,3,3,0,... So the first five elements? But the second output is [0,3,3,3,3], but the second input line starts with [3,3,3,3,3,0,...]. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe the output is taking the middle part? Or perhaps looking for sequences between zeros or certain markers.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is related to the central part of the input list. For instance, each input list might have a central element or a pattern that's extracted. But 24 elements is even, so the middle would be around positions 12 and 13. But the output is 5 elements. Alternatively, maybe the output is derived from specific positions in the input.\n\nWait, let's look at another example. In Example 1's input, the first line is [0,3,3,3,0,3,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,3,0,3,3,3,0], and the output starts with [6,6,6,6,6]. But where does 6 come from? Looking at the input lines, there's a line that starts with [0,8,8,0,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,0,8,8,0]. The 6s are in the middle of that line. Maybe each output list is taking a slice of five elements from the middle of each input list where a certain value is dominant.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first output, the output is all 3s except the first element. Looking at the first input list, perhaps the fifth element is the first element of the output? Or maybe it's a specific section. Alternatively, maybe each output list is the central five elements of the input list. Let's check:\n\nInput list length is 24. The middle five elements would be positions 10 to 14 (0-based index). Let's see: the first input list in Example 0 is [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. Elements 10 to 14 are 0,0,0,0,2. But the output is [0,3,3,3,3]. That doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first occurrence of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 0, the output lists have elements 3,0, etc., which might correspond to parts of the input.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs in Example 0, the outputs are 5 elements each. The first output line is [0,3,3,3,3], which matches the first five elements of the first input list. The second output line is [0,3,3,3,3], but the second input list starts with [3,3,3,3,3,0,...], so that's not the same. Wait, maybe it's the first five elements after a zero? Or maybe after a certain marker.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input list is divided into segments, and the output is the maximum value in each segment. For example, if each input list is split into 5-element segments (but 24 isn't divisible by 5). Alternatively, maybe the output is the first five non-zero elements. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input list: [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. The first five non-zero elements are 3,3,3,3,2. But the output is [0,3,3,3,3]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first five elements after some transformation. Like, the first five elements but with some operation. For example, the first element of the output is the first element of the input, then the next elements are the next ones. But in Example 0's first output, that matches. But the second output line in Example 0 is [0,3,3,3,3], but the second input line starts with [3,3,3,3,3,0,...]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the structure of the examples. Each example has multiple input lines and outputs. For example, in Example 0, there are 24 input lines (since the example lists 24 input lists) and 5 output lists. Wait, no. Wait, in the problem statement, each example's input is a list of lists, and the output is a list of lists. For example, in Example 0, the INPUT has 24 lists, each 24 elements long, and the OUTPUT has 5 lists of 5 elements each. Wait, but how? Let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0:\n\nThe INPUT shows multiple lists. For instance, the first input line is [0,3,3,3,3,0,...], then another line [3,3,3,3,3,0,...], etc. Then the OUTPUT is 5 lists. So perhaps each output list corresponds to a subset of the input lists, or there's a transformation applied to each input list individually to produce a part of the output.\n\nWait, but the first example's output has 5 lists, each with 5 elements. The input has 24 lists, each 24 elements. So 24 input lists, but only 5 output lists. So perhaps each output list is derived from a group of input lists. Or maybe each output list is derived from one input list by taking certain elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the central 5 elements of each input list. Let's check. For the first input list in Example 0: the 24 elements. The central 5 would be elements 10,11,12,13,14 (0-based index). The elements at these positions are 0,0,0,0,2. But the output is [0,3,3,3,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output list is a row in a matrix that's formed by some transformation of the input matrix. For example, maybe the input is a 24x24 grid, and the output is a 5x5 grid extracted from it. But how?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input: there are 24 input lists. Each list is 24 elements. So the input is a 24x24 grid. The output is 5 lists of 5 elements each, forming a 5x5 grid. So the task is to transform a 24x24 grid into a 5x5 grid using a certain pattern.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: notice that in each example's output, the elements are related to the middle of the input. For instance, in Example 1, the output includes a lot of 6s, which in the input lines are part of a middle section with 6s. Similarly, in Example 0, the outputs have 3s, 0s, etc.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the output is the 5x5 grid taken from the center of the 24x24 input grid. Since 24 is even, the center would be around positions 11-12. But taking a 5x5 grid around that. For example, rows 10-14 and columns 10-14. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first output line is [0,3,3,3,3]. Let's see which row in the input corresponds to that. The input lines are 24 rows. Let's pick row 0: [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. The elements around the middle (positions 10-14) are 0,0,0,0,2. But the output is [0,3,3,3,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a specific row in the input. For example, the first output row in Example 0 is [0,3,3,3,3], which is the first five elements of the first input row. The second output row is [0,3,3,3,3], which matches the first five elements of the first input row again. But that doesn't make sense, as there are five output rows. Maybe the output rows are the first five rows of the input, taking their first five elements. But in Example 0's input, the first five rows are:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,3,3,3,0,...]\n\nRow 1: [3,3,3,3,3,0,...]\n\nRow 2: [3,3,3,0,0,3,...]\n\nRow 3: [3,3,0,3,3,3,...]\n\nRow 4: [3,3,0,3,3,3,...]\n\nThe outputs are:\n\n[0,3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0,3]\n\nThe first output row matches the first five elements of row 0. The second output row seems to also match the first five elements of row 0 again. That doesn't fit. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking elements from the input rows in a certain pattern. For example, each output row is the 5th element from each of the first five input rows. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input. The test input has 24 lists, each 24 elements. The expected output should be 5 lists of 5 elements each, following the same pattern as the training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's first few lines:\n\nFirst line: [4,4,4,0,4,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,4,4,4]\n\nIf the output is taking the first five elements, then [4,4,4,0,4]. But I need to check if that's the pattern in the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the first output is [0,3,3,3,3], which are the first five elements of the first input line. The second output line is also [0,3,3,3,3], but the second input line starts with [3,3,3,3,3,0,...], so that's not matching. So that can't be it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from each input row. For example, in Example 0's output, the first element is 0, which is the first element of the first input row. The second element is 3, which is the second element of the same row. The third element is 3, third element. Fourth is 3, fourth. Fifth is 3, fifth. So the first output row is first five elements of first input row. But the second output row is [0,3,3,3,3], which would not match the second input row's first five elements. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is taken from a specific position in the input. For example, in Example 1's output, the first two output rows are [6,6,6,6,6], which could be the 7th row of the input. Let me check Example 1's input. The seventh line in Example 1's input is [0,8,8,0,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,0,8,8,0]. The middle elements here are 6s. Taking the first five 6s: positions 6-10: 6,6,6,6,6. So the output row would be [6,6,6,6,6]. But the output is five elements, so maybe they take the five 6s from that row. That seems to fit. Similarly, the third output row in Example 1 is [6,6,0,6,6]. Looking for an input row that has that pattern. For example, the eighth input line in Example 1 is [8,8,8,0,8,8,6,0,0,6,0,6,6,0,6,0,0,6,8,8,0,8,8,8]. The elements 6-10 here are 6,0,0,6,0. But the output is [6,6,0,6,6], which doesn't exactly match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are taken from the middle of the input rows where a certain value is present. For example, in Example 1's output, the first two rows are all 6s. Looking at the input rows, the seventh line in Example 1's input has a sequence of twelve 6s starting at position 6. So taking five of them in the middle might give the output rows. But the seventh input row in Example 1 is [0,8,8,0,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,0,8,8,0]. The 6s are from index 6 to 17. Taking positions 6-10: 6,6,6,6,6. So the first output row is that. Then the next row in the input (eighth line) is [8,0,8,0,0,0,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,0,0,0,8,0,8]. The 6s here start at index 6: 6,6,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,6,6. So taking elements 6-10: 6,6,0,6,6. Which matches the third output row of Example 1: [6,6,0,6,6]. So maybe each output row is the five elements starting at position 6 in each input row, but only for certain input rows.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input. Let's take the seventh line of Example 0's input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]. The elements from position 6 to 10 are 2,0,0,2,2. The corresponding output for Example 0's third line is [3,0,0,3,3]. That doesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by taking a specific column from the input grid. For example, the output is a 5x5 grid formed by the middle columns of the input. Let's imagine that the input is a 24x24 matrix, and the output is the center 5x5 portion. For 24 columns, the center would be columns 10-14 (since 24-5=19, so starting at 10). Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's first input row, columns 10-14 are 0,0,0,0,2. The first output row is [0,3,3,3,3], which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the test input's seventh line: [0,3,3,3,0,0,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,0,0,3,3,3,0]. The middle part has 1s and 8s. The output for the test might involve the 1s or 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to the most frequent number in a certain region of the input row. For example, in Example 1, the seventh input line has twelve 6s, so the output is all 6s. Another input line might have a mix, leading to some 6s and zeros.\n\nBut how to determine which input rows contribute to the output? In Example 0's output, there are five rows. The input has 24 rows, so perhaps every fifth row is taken? Or the middle five rows.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the output has five rows. The input has 24 rows. If we take the middle five rows, but 24/2 is 12, so rows 10-14. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 10 is [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]. The output rows in Example 0 are [0,3,3,3,3], [0,3,3,3,3], [3,0,0,3,3], etc. Not sure if they match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the fifth through ninth rows of the input, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is derived from the input by selecting the rows that contain a certain number of a particular value. For example, in Example 0's output, the first two rows are [0,3,3,3,3]. The input rows that start with 0 and have 3s. But again, this is speculative.\n\nAnother approach: consider that each example's output has the same number of rows as the number of distinct groups in the input. For example, in Example 0's input, there are 24 rows, but the output is 5 rows. Maybe each output row is a summary of a group of input rows. For instance, every 5th row is aggregated in some way. But 24 isn't a multiple of 5. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the central five rows of the input and then the central five elements of each of those rows. For example, in a 24x24 grid, take rows 10-14 (central five rows) and columns 10-14 (central five columns). That would form a 5x5 output.\n\nChecking Example 0:\n\nRow 10 of input is [0,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,0]. Columns 10-14 are 0,2,2,0,2. The output's third row is [3,0,0,3,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rows 6-10, columns 6-10. Let's check:\n\nRow 6 of Example 0's input is [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]. Columns 6-10: 2,0,0,2,2. The output's third row is [3,0,0,3,3]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the first output row is [0,5,5,0,5]. Looking at the test input, perhaps the pattern involves looking for sequences where certain numbers are grouped. For example, the middle part of each input line might have a cluster of numbers, and the output captures that cluster.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to the central five elements of the corresponding input row. Let's check:\n\nFor Example 0's first input row: [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. The central elements (assuming 24 elements, the middle would be positions 11 and 12). Taking 5 elements around that: positions 10-14: 0,0,0,0,2. But the output row is [0,3,3,3,3]. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is derived from the input by taking the first occurrence of a sequence of five consecutive elements that are non-zero. For Example 0's first input row, the sequence starts at index 1: 3,3,3,3,0. But the output is [0,3,3,3,3], which includes the first element (0). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output rows are the five middle rows of the input, and within those rows, the five middle elements. For a 24x24 grid, the middle five rows would be rows 10-14. For each of those rows, take elements 10-14. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's row 10: elements 10-14 are 0,2,2,0,2. The output for Example 0's third row is [3,0,0,3,3]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first five elements of certain rows. For Example 0's output, the first two rows are [0,3,3,3,3], which matches the first five elements of the first input row. Then the third output row is [3,0,0,3,3], which could be the first five elements of row 2, which is [3,3,3,0,0,3,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,3]. So the first five elements are 3,3,3,0,0. But the output is [3,0,0,3,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a transformation of each input row by replacing certain values. For example, in Example 0, the output has 0,3, etc. Maybe each input row is processed by taking the maximum value in each group of 5 elements, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first five elements after flipping the input row. For example, reversing the input row and taking the first five. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input row reversed would start with 0,1,1,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,3,3,3,3,0. The first five elements would be 0,1,1,1,1. Doesn't match the output [0,3,3,3,3].\n\nHmm. Let's think of the examples' outputs. In Example 0, the outputs have 0,3,0,3, etc. In Example 1, the outputs are mostly 6s. In Example 2, outputs have 5s and 0s.\n\nNow, looking at the test input's lines, especially the ones towards the middle (lines 6-10):\n\nLine 6: [0,3,3,3,0,0,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,0,0,3,3,3,0]\n\nLine 7: [3,3,3,3,0,3,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,3,0,3,3,3,3]\n\nLine 8: [3,3,0,0,3,3,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nLine 9: [3,3,0,0,3,3,8,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,8,0,0,8,3,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nLine 10: [0,0,3,3,0,3,8,0,8,1,1,1,1,1,8,8,0,8,3,0,3,3,0,0]\n\nThese lines contain sequences of 1s in the middle. For example, line 6 has 1s from position 9 to 13. So maybe the output is capturing these 1s. But in the training examples, the outputs are not directly taking those. For example, in Example 1's output, the 6s are from the middle part of the input lines. Similarly, in Example 2's output, the 5s are in the middle. So perhaps the output is taking the middle five elements of each input row where a certain pattern occurs, such as the presence of a specific number.\n\nIn the test input, lines 6-10 have 1s in positions 9-13. So perhaps the output for the test case is five rows of [1,1,1,1,1], but let's check the training examples to see if this pattern holds.\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh input line has a sequence of 6s in positions 6-17. The output for Example 1's first two rows are all 6s. This suggests that the output is taking the middle five elements of the input rows where the dominant value is present. \n\nSo for each input line that has a sequence of the same number in the middle, the output takes those five numbers. For example, in Example 1's seventh input line, the middle section has twelve 6s. Taking the middle five would be positions 9-13: 6,6,6,6,6. So the output is [6,6,6,6,6]. Then the eighth input line in Example 1 has a middle section with some 6s and zeros, leading to [6,6,0,6,6].\n\nApplying this logic to the test input: the seventh to eleventh lines have 1s in positions 9-13. For example, line 6 of the test input (seventh line overall, assuming input starts at line 0) is [0,3,3,3,0,0,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,0,0,3,3,3,0]. Positions 9-13 are 1,1,1,1,1. So the output row would be [1,1,1,1,1]. Similarly, line 7 has positions 9-13 as 1,1,1,1,0 (since the elements are [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,3,0,3,3,3,3]). Wait, no. Let me count again. Line 7: [3,3,3,3,0,3,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,3,0,3,3,3,3]. The elements from position 9 to 13 are 1,1,1,1,1. Then at position 14 it's 0. So positions 9-13 are all 1s. So the output row would be [1,1,1,1,1]. Similarly for line 8: [3,3,0,0,3,3,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,3,3,0,0,3,3]. Positions 9-13 are 1,1,1,1,1. Line 9: [3,3,0,0,3,3,8,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,8,0,0,8,3,3,0,0,3,3]. Positions 9-13 are 1,1,1,1,1. Line 10: [0,0,3,3,0,3,8,0,8,1,1,1,1,1,8,8,0,8,3,0,3,3,0,0]. Positions 9-13: 1,1,1,1,1. So all these lines would contribute [1,1,1,1,1] to the output. But in the training examples, sometimes there are variations. For example, in Example 1's eighth input line, the middle section has 6s and zeros. So perhaps the output takes the middle five elements, which could include other numbers.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the middle five elements (positions 9-13) for lines 6-10 are all 1s. So the output would have five rows of [1,1,1,1,1]. However, in the test input's line 11, which is [0,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,0], positions 9-13 would be 8,8,8,8,8. So that line's contribution to the output would be [8,8,8,8,8], but if the output is only five rows, maybe only the first five such rows are taken.\n\nWait, but the test input has 24 rows, and the output requires five rows. How to determine which five rows to pick? \n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\nExample 0 has 24 input rows and 5 output rows. The output rows correspond to the middle five input rows that have the relevant pattern. For example, in Example 0's input, the middle rows (say rows 10-14) might have the patterns seen in the output. Similarly, Example 1's output rows might be taken from the middle of the input.\n\nBut in the test input, the middle rows where the 1s are located are rows 6-10 (0-based indexing). So if we take those five rows (6-10), their middle five elements (positions 9-13) would be [1,1,1,1,1] each. Hence, the output would be five rows of [1,1,1,1,1].\n\nBut looking back at the training examples:\n\nIn Example 1, the output has five rows. The first two are [6,6,6,6,6], then [6,6,6,6,6], then [6,6,0,6,6], etc. Looking at the input rows for Example 1:\n\nRow 6: [0,8,8,0,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,0,8,8,0] \u2192 positions 9-13: 6,6,6,6,6 \u2192 output row [6,6,6,6,6]\n\nRow 7: [8,0,8,0,0,0,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,0,0,0,8,0,8] \u2192 positions 9-13: 6,6,6,6,6 \u2192 but the output row is [6,6,0,6,6]. Wait, this doesn't fit. Oh, wait, position 9-13 for row 7 would be indexes 9 to 13. Let's check:\n\nRow7: [8,0,8,0,0,0,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,0,0,0,8,0,8]\n\nIndices 0-23. So index 9 is 6, 10 is 6, 11 is 6, 12 is 6, 13 is 6. So positions 9-13: 6,6,6,6,6. But the third output row of Example 1 is [6,6,0,6,6]. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the output is not the middle five elements of each row, but a different section. Let me check the Example 1 output again.\n\nExample 1's third output row is [6,6,0,6,6]. Let's look at the eighth input line of Example 1:\n\nRow8: [8,8,8,0,8,8,6,0,0,6,0,6,6,0,6,0,0,6,8,8,0,8,8,8]\n\nPositions 9-13: 6,0,6,6,0. So that's 6,0,6,6,0. Which would form [6,0,6,6,0], but the output row is [6,6,0,6,6]. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first occurrence of five consecutive elements of the same value in each row. For example, in Example 0's first input row, the first five elements are 0,3,3,3,3, which has four 3s. The output is [0,3,3,3,3]. Maybe the longest run of non-zero values, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input's lines 6-10, which have 1s in positions 9-13. If the output is taking these five elements from each of these five rows, then the output would be five rows of [1,1,1,1,1]. But looking at the training examples, Example 1's output has varying values. However, in the test input's case, perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nBut according to the training examples, when there is a sequence of a certain number in the middle, the output captures that. For example, in Example 1, the seventh row of input (as per the list) has twelve 6s, so the output row is [6,6,6,6,6]. The eighth row has some 6s and zeros, so the output is [6,6,0,6,6]. So perhaps the output is taking the middle five elements of each row, regardless of their values.\n\nIf this is the case, then for the test input, the middle five elements of each row would be positions 10-14 (since 24 elements, the middle is positions 11.5, so from 10 to 14).\n\nWait, 24 elements, indices 0-23. The middle is between 11 and 12. So five elements would be 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.\n\nSo for each row, the output is elements at positions 10-14.\n\nLet's check this for the training examples.\n\nExample 0, first input row: [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. Elements 10-14 are 0,0,0,0,2. The first output row is [0,3,3,3,3]. So this doesn't match.\n\nExample 1, first input row: [0,3,3,3,0,3,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,3,0,3,3,3,0]. Elements 10-14 are 8,8,8,8,0. The first output row is [6,6,6,6,6]. Which doesn't match.\n\nSo this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 0: the five output rows are:\n\n[0,3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0,3]\n\nThese seem to form a pattern that could be part of a larger image. For example, the first two rows have 0 and 3s, then the next rows show 3s and 0s arranged in a sort of diagonal or pattern. This suggests that the output is a 5x5 grid that is a central part of the input's structure.\n\nAnother observation: the number of output rows in each example is 5, which might correspond to the number of unique elements in the input. For example, in Example 0, the input has numbers 0,1,2,3. The output uses 0 and 3. But Example 1's output has 6 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the transpose of a certain section of the input. For example, taking a 5x5 section from the input and transposing it. But without knowing which section, it's hard to say.\n\nLet me think differently. The outputs for the examples all have the same number of rows as the number of test outputs required. For each example, the output rows are derived from certain input rows. For example, in Example 0, there are 5 output rows, and the input has 24 rows. Maybe the output rows are every fifth row of the input, or rows 0, 5, 10, 15, 20. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input rows 0,5,10,15,20:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow 10: [0,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,0]\n\nRow 15: [2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,2]\n\nRow 20: [3,3,3,0,0,3,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,3,0,0,3,3,3]\n\nThe output for Example 0 is:\n\n[0,3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,0,3]\n\nNone of these rows match the first five elements of rows 0,5,10,15,20.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input's first few lines:\n\nThe first line is [4,4,4,0,4,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,4,4,4]. The middle elements (positions 10-14) are 0,0,0,0,3. If the output is derived from these, but the expected output isn't clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first five elements of each input row after some transformation. For example, replacing certain values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first five elements of the input rows that are symmetrical. For example, rows that are palindromes in the first five elements. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother idea: the output lists in the examples are palindromes. For Example 0's output:\n\n[0,3,3,3,3] is not a palindrome. The second line is the same. Third line [3,0,0,3,3] is not a palindrome. Fourth line [3,3,3,0,3] isn't. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the first five elements of the input rows, but mirrored. For example, the first input row's first five elements are [0,3,3,3,3], which is the same as the output row. So no mirroring.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nThe first output row is [0,5,5,0,5]. Looking at the input's seventh line (assuming 0-based), which is [5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,5]. The elements at positions 10-14 are 5,5,5,5,0. But the output row is [0,5,5,0,5]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be formed by taking the fifth element from each of the first five rows. For example, in Example 0's input, the fifth element of each row might form the output. But the fifth element of the first input row is 3 (0,3,3,3,3,0...), which is the fifth element. The output's first row is [0,3,3,3,3]. So that's not matching.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking the fifth column of the input grid. For example, each output row is the fifth column's first five elements. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the diagonal of the input matrix. For a 24x24 matrix, taking the central 5x5's diagonal. But this seems complicated.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern in the examples.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first two rows are the same. Then the next rows change. Maybe the output is a 5x5 matrix that's a compressed version of the input's central area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the average or mode of each row's elements, but represented as a list. For Example 0, the first output row is [0,3,3,3,3], which could be the first five elements of the first input row. But the mode of the entire input row is 3, but the output isn't all 3s.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the first five elements of each input row, but with some transformation. For example, replacing certain numbers. In Example 0, maybe 0 remains 0, 1 becomes 3, 2 becomes 3, but that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first five elements of the input row, but with all non-zero elements replaced with the row's first non-zero element. For example, first input row of Example 0: [0,3,3,3,3...] \u2192 output [0,3,3,3,3]. Second input row starts with [3,3,3,3,3...] \u2192 output [3,3,3,3,3], but Example 0's output's second row is [0,3,3,3,3], which contradicts this.\n\nHmm. This is taking too long. Let's try to make a educated guess based on the test input.\n\nIn the test input, the middle rows (6-10) have 1s in positions 9-13. So if the output is taking those five elements from each of those five rows, the output would be five rows of [1,1,1,1,1]. But looking at the training examples:\n\nIn Example 1's output, the first two rows are [6,6,6,6,6], which correspond to the middle rows of the input where 6s are in positions 6-17. Taking five elements from there would give all 6s. Then, other rows might have different values.\n\nBut the test input's middle rows have 1s. So the output should be five rows of [1,1,1,1,1]. However, looking at the training examples, this isn't always the case. For example, Example 2's output has varying values. But perhaps each example's output is based on the dominant number in the middle of the input.\n\nSo, given the test input's middle rows have 1s, the output should be five rows of [1,1,1,1,1].",
