        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the training examples carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 0. The input has a diagonal of 7s, and some 5s in the fourth and fifth rows. The output seems to modify this. Let me compare the input and output rows.\n\nIn the input's first row, it's [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output for that row is [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Oh, so the 7 is now at position 0 and 4. Then the second input row is [0,7,0,...], output is [0,7,0,0,0,7,0,...]. So the 7s are at position 1 and 5. It looks like each original 7 in the diagonal is being duplicated four positions to the right. Wait, but for the fourth row input, which is [0,0,0,7,5,5,0,...], the output becomes [0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0]. Wait, original 7 is at index 3, and then another 7 at index 7. So the offset here is 4? So each 7 in the input is placed at positions i and i+4 in the output row. But wait, in the first example's output rows, the 7s are spaced four apart. Let me check:\n\nRow 0 input: 7 at 0 \u2192 output 7 at 0 and 4 (difference 4)\nRow 1 input: 7 at 1 \u2192 output at 1 and 5 (difference 4)\nRow 2: 7 at 2 \u2192 output at 2 and 6 (diff 4)\nRow 3: 7 at 3 \u2192 output at 3 and 7 (diff 4)\nRow 4: 7 at 4 \u2192 output at 4 and 8 (diff 4)\nRow 5: 7 at 5 \u2192 output at 5 and 9 (diff 4, but 5+4 is 9, which is index 9, okay)\nRows 6-9 input have 7 at positions 6,7,8,9. Output for row 6 is 7 at 6 (since 6+4=10, which is beyond the array, so only 6?), same for the rest. So the pattern is, for each 7 in the input row, place it in the same position and four positions to the right. But if adding 4 exceeds the array length, then it's not placed. But looking at row 3 in the input: original 7 is at index 3. In the output, it's at 3 and 7. Then in row 4 of input, the 7 is at 4, so output 4 and 8. Then row 5's 7 is at 5, output 5 and 9. So that's adding 4 each time. So the rule seems to be that each element (maybe 7 here) is moved to the same position and shifted 4 places to the right, but only if possible. Also, what about the 5s in the input? In example 0, the input's fourth row has 5s at positions 4 and 5. The output for that row is [0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0]. Wait, the original 7 is at index 4 here. So maybe the 5s are being ignored, and only the 7s are being duplicated. Wait, maybe the 5s are part of the input but not part of the transformation. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero number (like 7, 9, 2 in other examples) is being moved to the same position and four places to the right. But in Example 1, let's see. The input's first row has 9 at position 5. The output's first row is same. But the second input row in example 1 has 9 at position 6. The output's second row (row index 1) is [9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0]. Wait, original 9 was at index 6 (input row 1) but in output row 0, the 9 is at 5 and in row 1's output, 9 is at 0 and 6? Hmm, maybe this is a different pattern.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's input. The input has a sequence of 5s and a 9. The output seems to create a diagonal of 9s starting from the first row. The output rows for example 1 have 9s in positions that form a diagonal. For example, row 0 has 9 at 5, row 1 has 9 at 0 and 6, row 2 has 9 at 1 and 7, etc. Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let's think again. Maybe the 9s in the input are being moved up and shifted left or something.\n\nWait, example 1's input:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,5,9,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,9,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,9,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,9]\n\nThe output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: same as input row 0.\n\nRow 1: [9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0]\n\nHmm. It looks like the 9s from the input are forming a diagonal that starts at position 5 in row 0, then moves up. Wait, the output's row 0 has 9 at position 5. Then row 1 has 9 at 0 and 6. Wait, how does that happen? Maybe the 9s from the input are being \"expanded\" into a diagonal. Let's see. The input's first 9 is in row 0, column 5. The output's row 0 has it there. Then the next 9 in the input is row 1, column 6. But in the output, row 1 has 9 at column 0 and 6. That doesn't fit. Maybe there's a different pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each non-zero element (like 9) is moved up by a certain number of rows and to the left by a certain number of columns. For example, in the input's row 1, column 6 has a 9. The output's row 1 has 9 in column 0 and 6. Wait, moving left by 6 columns? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the 9s are being shifted in a way that creates a diagonal pattern. For instance, in the output, the 9s start at row 0, column 5, then row 1 column 0 and 6, row 2 column 1 and 7, row 3 column 2 and 8, row4 column 3 and9, etc. So it's like each 9 from the input is split into two parts, moving left and creating a diagonal. Wait, perhaps for each 9 in the input, it's being placed in two positions: one shifted up and left, and another shifted down and right. But this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me look at example 2. Input is a 10x10 array. The output seems to have a pattern where the 2s are in a diagonal that wraps around. For example, in example 2's output:\n\nRow 0 has 2 at index 3.\n\nRow 1 has 2 at 0 and 4.\n\nRow 2 has 2 at 1 and 5.\n\nRow 3 has 2 at 2 and 6.\n\nRow 4 has 2 at 3 and7.\n\nRow5 has 2 at4 and8.\n\nRow6 has 2 at0,5,9.\n\nHmm, perhaps the pattern here is that each 2 in the input is being moved to a new position that's a certain offset. For instance, the input's row 3 has a 2 at index 2, and in the output row3, the 2 is at index 2 and 6 (difference 4 again). Similarly, the input row4 has 2 at index3, output row4 has 2 at 3 and7 (diff 4). So this aligns with the first example's pattern of shifting 4 positions to the right. But then in example2's input, the 2s are in the diagonal and the 5s, but the output creates a pattern where each 2 is in the same position and shifted 4 to the right. But wait, the output in example2's row6 is [2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2], which has 2 at 0,5,9. That's a shift of 5 each time. Hmm, maybe this isn't the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero number (excluding 5s?) is being moved to the same column but in the row above, and then also shifted to another position. Or maybe it's creating a diagonal that's spaced every 4 columns. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero number (like 7,9,2) is being duplicated in the same row but four columns to the right. But in example0, for row0, 7 is at 0 and4. In example1's output row1, 9 is at0 and6. So 0 to6 is a shift of 6, which doesn't fit the 4 shift. So maybe this isn't the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero elements (excluding 5s) are creating a diagonal that is offset by a certain number of rows and columns. For example, in example0's output, the 7s form a diagonal starting at row0, column0 and another starting at row0, column4, creating a two-diagonal pattern. Similarly, in example1's output, the 9s form a diagonal starting at row0, column5 and another starting at row1, column0. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to take the positions of the non-zero elements (excluding 5s) and arrange them in a diagonal pattern that's offset by 4 columns. Let's think again. For example, in example0's input, the 7s are along the main diagonal. The output has them along two diagonals: the original and another shifted 4 columns to the right. So each 7 is in its original position and also 4 columns to the right. If that's the case, then for any non-zero element (like 7,9,2), they are duplicated in the same row, shifted 4 columns to the right, provided there is space.\n\nLet's check example0. The input has 7s in positions (0,0), (1,1), etc. The output has each 7 at (0,0) and (0,4), (1,1) and (1,5), etc. So that's a shift of +4. For example, row0's 7 is at 0 and4. Row1's at1 and5. Yes, that fits. For the fourth row (row3), input has 7 at3,3, output has 7 at3,3 and3,7. But in row3 of the input, the 7 is at index3, and 3+4=7, so yes. Then row4's 7 is at index4, shifted to8, but row4's output has 7 at4 and8. So yes. Then row5's 7 is at5 and9.\n\nIn example1, the input's first 9 is in row0, column5. Output row0 has 9 at5. Then in row1 of the input, there's a9 at column6. The output row1 has 9 at0 and6. So the 9 at6 in the input is placed in row1,6 (same position) and also at row1,0 (which is 6-6=0). Wait, that doesn't fit the +4 shift. So maybe this isn't the same pattern.\n\nAlternatively, in example1's output, the 9s form a diagonal that starts at row0, column5 and then continues in a diagonal fashion. The output has 9s at (0,5), (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4), (6,5), (7,6), (8,7), (9,8). So each subsequent 9 is moving one row down and one column to the left. But how does that relate to the input? The input has 9s in positions (0,5), (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9). So in the input, each 9 is in column (5 + row index). So for row0, 5+0=5. row1,5+1=6. row2,5+2=7. etc. But in the output, the 9s start at (0,5), then (1,0), which is a jump of row+1, column-5. Then each next 9 is row+1, column+1. So this forms two diagonals. The first diagonal is (0,5), (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4), (6,5), etc. So from row0 to row1, the column jumps from5 to0. Then after that, it's a diagonal of +1 row and +1 column. But how is this related to the input?\n\nWait, the input's 9s are in columns 5,6,7,8,9 for rows0-4. The output's 9s are arranged in two parts: one part is the original 9s shifted somehow, and another part is a new diagonal. Maybe the transformation is that each 9 in the input is moved up by some rows and to the left by some columns, and then another copy is placed in a different position. For example, the input's row1 has a9 at column6. The output's row1 has a9 at column0 and6. So how does that happen? 6-6=0. Maybe each 9 in column c is split into two positions: c-6 and c. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example1 is creating a diagonal that starts at (0,5) and then wraps around. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero element (like the 9s and 5s are ignored) is moved to the row corresponding to the column index and column (row index + some value). For example, in example1's input, the first 9 is at (0,5). The output has 9 at (0,5) and (5,5). Wait, but in the output, row5 has 9 at column4. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to see what's common between all examples. \n\nLooking at example0's transformation: each 7 is placed at (row, column) and (row, column+4). If there's no room (like column+4 >=10), then it's placed only once.\n\nIn example1's input, the 9s are in positions (0,5), (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9). The output's 9s are:\n\nRow0:5\n\nRow1:0 and6\n\nRow2:1 and7\n\nRow3:2 and8\n\nRow4:3 and9\n\nRow5:4 \n\nRow6:5\n\nRow7:6 \n\nRow8:7 \n\nRow9:8 \n\nSo it's like each 9 from the input is split into two positions in the output. For example, input's (0,5) \u2192 output's row0:5 and row5:4. Wait, not sure. Or perhaps each 9 in the input is shifted up by (row index) rows and left by (row index) columns, and also kept in place. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the non-zero elements are being spread out into two diagonals. For example0, the original diagonal (main diagonal) and another diagonal shifted 4 columns to the right. For example1, the original diagonal is shifted to the right by 5 columns (from column5) and another diagonal starting at column0. Example2's output has a diagonal starting at column3 for row0, then column0 and4 for row1, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to take each non-zero element (excluding 5) and create a diagonal that starts at that element's position and continues downwards and to the right, but with some offset. For example, in example0, each 7 starts a diagonal that continues down and right by 4 positions. Wait, no. Because in example0's output, the 7s are in positions (0,0), (0,4), (1,1), (1,5), etc. So each row has two 7s spaced 4 apart. So for each original 7, it's placed in the same position and shifted 4 columns to the right in the same row. But how does that fit with example1's output?\n\nIn example1's input, the first 9 is in row0, column5. The output has 9 in row0,5 and row1,0. Wait, how is 0 derived from 5? 5-5=0? Maybe in example1, the non-zero elements are shifted up by their column index minus 5. For example, 5 (column5) shifted up by 0 (5-5=0) \u2192 same row. Then in row1, the 9 is at column6. 6-5=1, so shifted up by 1 row. So row1-1=0, column6-5=1 \u2192 but row0, column1 doesn't have a9. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation for each example depends on the value of the non-zero elements. For example, in example0, value 7: shift 4 columns (7 mod something?). But 7 mod 3 is 1, not sure. 7-5=2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift amount is determined by the number of rows. For example0, which has a 10x10 grid, shifting 4 columns. 10-4=6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The input has 1s and 5s. The 1s are in positions:\n\nRow0: column1\n\nRow1: column2\n\nRow2: column3\n\nRow3: column4\n\nRow4: column5\n\nRow5: column6\n\nRow6: column7\n\nRow7: column8\n\nRow8: column9\n\nRow9: none.\n\nBut according to the input, row0 has 0,1,0... So the 1s are along a diagonal starting at row0, column1. The output should follow the pattern.\n\nAssuming that the transformation is to shift each non-zero (except 5) element 4 columns to the right in the same row. So for each 1 in the input, place it in the same column and also column+4.\n\nSo for example, row0's 1 is at column1. So output would have 1 at 1 and 5.\n\nRow1's input 1 is at column2 \u2192 output at2 and6.\n\nRow2's input 1 at3 \u2192 output at3 and7.\n\nRow3's input 1 at4 \u2192 output at4 and8.\n\nRow4's input 1 at5 \u2192 output at5 and9.\n\nRow5's input 1 at6 \u2192 output at6 (since6+4=10, which is beyond, so only6.\n\nSimilarly, row6's input 1 at7 \u2192 output at7 (7+4=11 invalid).\n\nRow7's input 1 at8 \u2192 output at8 (8+4=12 invalid).\n\nRow8's input 1 at9 \u2192 output at9 (9+4=13 invalid).\n\nSo the output should have each 1 duplicated 4 columns to the right. Let's check if this matches the training examples.\n\nIn example0, the 7s are duplicated with shift4. Yes. Example1's 9s: if the input's 9s are duplicated with shift4, let's see. The first input 9 is at row0,5. So output would have 9 at5 and9. But in example1's output, row0 has 9 at5, which matches. But row0's output doesn't have 9 at9. So maybe that's not the case. Hmm, but example1's output has row4's output as [0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9], which would fit a shift of4 (from column5 to9). Wait, but the input's 9 in row4 is at column9. So output would be column9 and 9+4=13, which is invalid, so only9. But in example1's output, row4 has 9 at3 and9. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the shift amount is related to the value of the number. For example0, value7. 7-5=2. Shift by 2. But in example0, the shift is4. Doesn't fit. Example1 has value9. 9-5=4. So shift4. Let's check. The first input 9 in row0, column5. Shifting4 to the right would be column9. But in the output, row0 has 9 at5 and no others. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for a pattern in how the output rows are generated from the input rows.\n\nIn example0:\n\nInput rows are diagonal 7s. Output rows have two 7s per row, each spaced4 apart. For example, row0:7 at0 and4. row1:7 at1 and5. etc. So it's like a knight's move in chess, but horizontally.\n\nIn example1:\n\nThe input has 9s starting at row0, column5 and then each subsequent row's 9 is one column to the right. The output seems to create a diagonal that starts at row0, column5 and then each next row the 9 moves left by one column. So row0:5, row1:0, row2:1, row3:2, etc. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for each row is combining elements from multiple input rows. For example, in example0's output row0:7,0,0,0,7,0\u2026 which suggests that it's combining the 7 from input row0 and perhaps the 7 from input row4 (since 0+4=4, but row4's 7 is at column4, which is the fifth element. So input row0's 7 at0 and input row4's 7 at4 could be merged into output row0's 7s at0 and4. Similarly, output row1 has 7s at1 and5. Input row1 has7 at1, input row5 has7 at5. So merging row1 and row5's 7s into output row1. If that's the case, then the pattern is that each output row i is a combination of input row i and input row i+4, taking their non-zero elements. So for example0, output row0 is input row0's 7 at0 and input row4's 7 at4. Similarly, output row1 is input row1's7 at1 and input row5's7 at5.\n\nBut let's check example1. The input's 9s are in rows0-4. The output's 9s are in rows0-9. For example, output row5 has9 at4. But input row5 has no 9s. So this approach might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each non-zero element (excluding 5) and creating two copies: one in the same position and another four rows below and four columns to the right. But example0 has 10 rows, so adding four rows may loop around. For example, row0's7 at0 would also be placed in row4's column4. But in example0's output row0, the 7 is at0 and4. Row4's output has7 at4 and8. So maybe it's adding to the same row, not four rows below.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. In example0, the output's first five rows have two 7s each, spaced four apart. Then the last five rows have one 7 each. Similarly, example1's output has 9s arranged in a diagonal that starts at column5 and then wraps around. \n\nAnother observation: in example0's input, the 7s are on the main diagonal, and the output has them on two diagonals: main diagonal and another diagonal shifted four columns to the right. So the main diagonal and a diagonal offset by +4. In example1's input, the 9s form a diagonal starting at column5. The output's 9s are on a diagonal starting at column5 and another starting at column0, which is shifted by -5. Example2's output seems to have 2s on two diagonals as well. \n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero element (excluding 5) is placed in two positions: the original position and another position shifted left by (10 - shift) columns, where the shift is 4. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is based on the value of the number. For example, 7's shift is 4 (7 mod 5 = 2? Not sure). 9's shift could be 4 (9-5=4). So 9 is shifted 4 columns to the left. For example, in example1's input, row1 has9 at column6. Shifting 4 left would give column2, but in the output row1, it's at column0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is such that for each non-zero element, you subtract 5. For example, 7-5=2 \u2192 shift 2. But in example0, the shift is4. Doesn't fit. For 9-5=4. Shift4. Let's see example1's input row0,9 at5. Shift4 to the left would be 5-4=1. But output row0 has9 at5. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the output rows in the training examples and see if they're formed by some rotation or reflection of the input.\n\nIn example0, the input is a diagonal matrix with 7s and some 5s. The output seems to have 7s along the main diagonal and another diagonal shifted four columns to the right. So it's like the original diagonal and a new diagonal with offset +4.\n\nIn example1, the input has a diagonal of 9s starting at column5. The output has two diagonals: one starting at column5 and another starting at column0. The distance between the two starting columns is5. \n\nExample2's input has a diagonal of 2s and 5s. The output has 2s forming two diagonals: one starts at column3 in row0 and another starts at column0 in row1. So the offset is varying.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe the pattern is different. Let's think about the positions of the non-zero elements in the output compared to the input.\n\nIn example0's input, the non-zero elements (excluding 5s) are at positions (i,i) for i from0 to9. The output has non-zero elements at (i,i) and (i, i+4), for i from0 to5. For i from6 to9, only (i,i) since i+4 exceeds the array.\n\nIn example1's input, the non-zero elements (excluding 5s) are at positions (0,5), (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9). The output has non-zero elements at (0,5), (1,0), (1,6), (2,1), (2,7), (3,2), (3,8), (4,3), (4,9), (5,4), (6,5), (7,6), (8,7), (9,8). So for each input element (i, 5+i), the output places two elements: (i, 5+i) and (i+1, i). For example, input's (0,5) \u2192 output (0,5) and (1,0). (1,6) \u2192 (1,6) and (2,1). (2,7) \u2192 (2,7) and (3,2). Etc. This creates two diagonals: one that continues the original and another that wraps around to the start. \n\nIf that's the pattern, then for each non-zero element in the input at (i,j), the output places two elements: one at (i,j) and another at (i+1, j - (5)), perhaps. Let's see: j=5+i in the input. So j -5 = i. So the second position is (i+1, i). For example, input (0,5) \u2192 i=0, j=5. j-5=0 \u2192 new position (0+1, 0) \u2192 (1,0). Input (1,6) \u2192 j-5=1 \u2192 new position (2,1). Yes. This seems to fit. \n\nSo for each non-zero element (excluding 5s) at (i,j) in the input, the output places the same element at (i,j) and (i+1, j-5). But j-5 may be negative. Wait, in example1's input, j=5+i. So j-5 =i. So the new position is (i+1, i). Which for i=0: (1,0). For i=1: (2,1). For i=4: (5,4). Then, for rows beyond i=4 in the input, there are no elements, but the output continues the pattern. For example, in the output's row5, there's a 9 at4, which would come from input's i=4, j=9. (4+1,9-5)=(5,4). Yes. So the pattern is that each non-zero element (like9) in the input is placed at (i,j) and (i+1, j-5). If j-5 is negative, perhaps it wraps around? But in example1's input, j is always >=5, so j-5 is i, which is >=0.\n\nIn example0, the input elements are at (i,i). Applying the same rule: j=i. j-5= i-5. So the new position is (i+1, i-5). For example, i=0: j=0, new position (1, -5) which is invalid. So no placement. So why does example0's output have the second 7 at (i, i+4)?\n\nWait, this doesn't align with example0. So perhaps the pattern is different. \n\nAnother observation: in example0's input, the 7s are on the main diagonal. The output has them on the main diagonal and another diagonal that is shifted by4 columns to the right. So for each 7 at (i,i), there's also a7 at (i, i+4). \n\nIn example1's input, the 9s are on (i, 5+i). The output has them on (i,5+i) and (i+1, i). So for each 9 at (i,j) in the input, the output has (i,j) and (i+1, j-5). \n\nIn example2's input, the 2s are on (i, i) for i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The output has 2s on (i, i) and (i+4, i). For example, input row3 has2 at3. Output row3 has2 at3 and7 (3+4=7). But example2's output row0 has2 at3. How does that fit? Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, example2's output shows that for each 2 in the input, it's placed in the same row, shifted4 columns to the right. For example, input row3 has2 at2. Output row3 has2 at2 and6 (2+4=6). Similarly, input row4 has2 at3. Output row4 has2 at3 and7. But row0's output has2 at3. Maybe the input has some other elements contributing to that. For example, the input's row3 has a2 at2 and5s. But in the output, row0 has2 at3. This suggests that the pattern may involve more than just shifting the same row's elements.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to find a general rule that can explain all examples.\n\nLooking at the three examples:\n\nExample0: 7s on main diagonal \u2192 output has 7s on main diagonal and main diagonal +4 columns.\n\nExample1: 9s on diagonal starting at (0,5) \u2192 output has 9s on original diagonal and a new diagonal starting at (1,0).\n\nExample2: 2s on a diagonal that is shifted due to some 5s in the input. Output has 2s arranged in a more spread out diagonal pattern.\n\nThe common theme might be that each non-zero element (excluding 5s) is used to create two entries in the output: one at the original position and another at a position determined by some function of the original position.\n\nIn example0, the new position is original column +4.\n\nIn example1, the new position is (i+1, i), which is equivalent to (i+1, j-5) since j=5+i.\n\nIn example2, the new position seems to be original column +4 for some rows and others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is determined by the value of the element. For example, 7 \u2192 shift4 (7-3=4?), 9\u2192 shift5 (9-4=5?), 2\u2192 shift1 (2+2=4?). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is 4 in all cases, but for example1, the original elements are further right, so when shifted right by4, they wrap around to the start.\n\nWait, in example1's input, the 9s are in columns 5-9. Shifting them right by4 would take column5 to9 (5+4=9), column6 to10 (invalid), so they wrap around to0. For example, column6 shifted right4 would be6+4=10 \u2192 mod10=0. So, 9 in (i,j) would be placed at (i, (j+4) mod 10). So for input (0,5):5+4=9 mod10=9 \u2192 output (0,5) and (0,9). But example1's output for row0 has9 at5, not9. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a shift left by4. For example1's 9 at5:5-4=1 \u2192 output at1. But in example1's output row0 has9 at5, not1. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the shift depends on the row index. For example, in example0's output, each row has two 7s spaced4 apart. So for rowi, the 7s are ati andi+4. But this only works for rows where i+4 <10. \n\nIn example1's output, the 9s are in positions that for rowi, the columns arei-1 andi+5-1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is based on the row index modulo something. For example0, rowi: shift4 columns. For example1, rowi: shift (5 - rowi) columns. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to apply the hypothesis from example0 and example2. Assume that each non-zero element (not5) is duplicated in the same row, shifted4 columns to the right. Let's test this on example1's input.\n\nExample1's input row0 has9 at5. Shifted4 would be9, which is column9. So output row0 should have9 at5 and9. But example1's output row0 has only9 at5. So this doesn't fit. But in example1's output row4, there is a9 at3 and9. Column3+4=7, not9. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for a pattern in the output rows. For example, in example0's output rows, the 7s are in positions i and i+4. For example1's output, the 9s form two diagonals: one starts at row0, column5 and steps down-right, and another starts at row1, column0 and steps down-right. So for each 9 in the input, it's split into two diagonals: one is the original, and another is shifted to the left by5 columns and down by1 row. \n\nFor example, input's (0,5) \u2192 output (0,5) and (1,0). (1,6) \u2192 (1,6) and (2,1). So each 9 is placed in the same position and one row below, 5 columns to the left. But 5 columns to the left from column5 is0, which fits.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each non-zero element (excluding 5s) at (i,j), the output has two elements: (i,j) and (i+1, j-5). If j-5 is negative, then it wraps around. But in example1's case, j-5 for input elements is i (since j=5+i), so j-5=i. So the new position is (i+1, i).\n\nApplying this to example0's input: 7s are at (i,i). So j=i. j-5 =i-5. So new position is (i+1, i-5). For example, i=0: (1, -5) which is invalid, so no. i=1: (2,-4) invalid. So only for i >=5 would this be valid. But example0's output has 7s at (0,0) and (0,4). So this doesn't fit.\n\nThus, this pattern works for example1 but not example0 and example2.\n\nPerhaps the pattern varies between examples. But that's unlikely. There must be a general rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is to split each non-zero element into two elements: one in the same position and another in the same row, but shifted by (element's value) columns. For example, if the element is 7, shift 7 mod 10 columns. But 7 mod 10 is7, which would be a shift of7. But example0's output has a shift of4. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is determined by the number of non-zero elements in the row. For example0's rows have one non-zero (7) so shift4. Example1's rows have varying numbers. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother observation: in all three examples, the output seems to create a pattern where the non-zero elements form two diagonals. The first diagonal is the same as the input's, and the second is shifted by a certain number of columns. For example0, shift +4. Example1, shift -5. Example2, shift +1 or +4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the second diagonal in the output is a mirror or reflection. For example, example0's output has a diagonal shifted to the right by4, example1's output has a diagonal shifted to the left by5 (since 5 columns to the left of column5 is column0), example2's output has a diagonal shifted to the right by3 or something. But this isn't consistent.\n\nPerhaps the key is to ignore the 5s and look at the other numbers (7,9,2) and see how they are transformed.\n\nIn example0: 7s are duplicated with a shift of+4 in the same row.\n\nIn example1: 9s are duplicated with a shift of-5 in the same row and down by1.\n\nIn example2: 2s are duplicated with a shift of+4. For example, input row3 has2 at2 \u2192 output at2 and6 (2+4=6). Row4's 2 at3 \u21923+4=7. Row5's2 at4 \u21924+4=8. Row6's input has2 at5 \u21925+4=9. Row7's2 at6 \u21926+4=10 invalid. So the output for these rows would have 2s at the same position and +4. But the test input has 1s. So applying the same rule, each 1 would be duplicated +4.\n\nBut in example1's case, this doesn't fit. So maybe the shift depends on the number itself. For example, 7\u21924, 9\u21925, 2\u21923. Let's see:\n\n7: 7 mod 3 =1 \u2192 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is the value of the number minus 3. 7-3=4. 9-3=6. 2-3= -1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is the value of the number divided by 2, rounded down. 7/2=3.5\u21923. 9/2=4.5\u21924. 2/2=1. Doesn't fit example0's shift of4.\n\nHmm. This is really tricky. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example2's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: 2 at0.\n\nRow2: 2 at1.\n\nRow3: 2 at2, 5s.\n\nRow4: 2 at3, 5s.\n\nRow5: 2 at4,5s.\n\nRow6: 2 at5,5s.\n\nRow7: 2 at6.\n\nRow8:2 at7.\n\nRow9:2 at8.\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0:2 at3.\n\nRow1:2 at0 and4.\n\nRow2:2 at1 and5.\n\nRow3:2 at2 and6.\n\nRow4:2 at3 and7.\n\nRow5:2 at4 and8.\n\nRow6:2 at0,5,9.\n\nRow7:2 at1,6.\n\nRow8:2 at2,7.\n\nRow9:2 at3,8.\n\nSo the output has 2s arranged in a diagonal that starts at row0,3 and increments both row and column by1 each time. Another diagonal starts at row1,0 and increments both. Another diagonal starts at row6,0,5,9. This is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking each non-zero element (excluding 5) and placing it in the same position and also in a position that is 4 rows below and 4 columns to the right. For example, in example0's row0, 7 at0,4 would be from row0's 7 and row4's 7. But example0's input row4 has7 at4. Output row0's 7 at4 is from input row4's 7. So maybe the output is combining elements from different input rows.\n\nFor example, output rowi is a combination of input rowi and input row (i-4) mod 10. So for example0's row0: input row0 and input row6 (since 0-4 =-4 \u2192 mod10=6). But input row6 has7 at6. So output row0 would have7 from row0 and row6. But output row0 has7 at0 and4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output rowi has elements from input rowi and input rowi+4. So row0 in output takes from row0 and row4. Example0's input row4 has7 at4. So output row0 has7 at0 (from row0) and4 (from row4). That fits. Similarly, output row1 has7 at1 (from row1) and5 (from row5). Because row5's input has7 at5. Yes! This seems to fit example0.\n\nSo the pattern is: each output rowi is a combination of input rowi and input rowi+4. For each non-zero element in input rowi and input rowi+4, they are placed in output rowi. But example0's input rowi+4 has7 ati+4's row. So for example, output row0 is input row0 and input row4. input row0 has7 at0, input row4 has7 at4. So output row0 has7s at0 and4. Similarly, output row1 has7s at1 (from input row1) and5 (from input row5). For rows i where i+4 >=10, input rowi+4 doesn't exist, so output rowi only has the element from input rowi. For example, output row6 has7 at6 (from input row6) and no other since row10 doesn't exist.\n\nThis pattern fits example0 perfectly. Let's check example1.\n\nExample1's input rows:\n\nRow0:9 at5.\n\nRow1:9 at6.\n\nRow2:9 at7.\n\nRow3:9 at8.\n\nRow4:9 at9.\n\nRows5-9: all zeros except for 5s.\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0:9 at5 (from row0 and row4. Input row4 has9 at9. So output row0 would have9 at5 and9. But example1's output row0 has9 only at5. So this doesn't fit. Hmm. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking each non-zero element in the input and placing it in the same row but shifted 4 columns to the right, and also leaving the original in place. If the shifted position is beyond the array, it wraps around to the beginning. So for example, in example0's input row0,7 at0. Shifted4 \u21924. So output row0 has7 at0 and4. Example1's input row0 has9 at5. Shifted4 \u21929. So output row0 has9 at5 and9. But example1's output row0 has9 only at5. So this doesn't fit. \n\nSo this pattern explains example0 but not example1. Therefore, there must be another pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking each non-zero element and creating a diagonal that starts at that element's position and steps down and to the right by 1 each time, for a certain number of steps. For example, in example0's input, each 7 starts a diagonal that continues for a few steps. But example0's output shows each 7 duplicated in the same row. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Let's try to think of a different approach. \n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input has 1s in a diagonal pattern. The 1s are in positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (8,9). The 5s are in various positions.\n\nIf we apply the pattern from example0 (shift 4 to the right in the same row), then the output would have each 1 at original position and +4 columns. For example:\n\nRow0:1 at1 \u21921 and5.\n\nRow1:1 at2 \u21922 and6.\n\nRow2:3 \u21923 and7.\n\nRow3:4 \u21924 and8.\n\nRow4:5 \u21925 and9.\n\nRow5:6 \u21926 (since6+4=10, no).\n\nRow6:7 \u21927 (7+4=11 invalid).\n\nRow7:8 \u21928.\n\nRow8:9 \u21929.\n\nRow9: no 1s.\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,1,5,5,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but the input's row1 is [0,0,1,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]. Applying shift4 would make 1 at2 and6. But the output should have 1 at2 and6, but also the 5s are present. But in the training examples, the 5s are ignored. So in the output, the 5s are kept as they are, and the 1s are duplicated. \n\nSo for example, row1's output would be [0,0,1,5,5,0,1,0,0,0].\n\nSimilarly, row2's input has1 at3 \u2192 output 3 and7.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the 5s are kept in the output. For example, example0's input has5s in row3 and4, and the output includes them. So the 5s are not modified, but the non-5 non-zero elements are duplicated with a shift.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 becomes [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: [0,0,1,5,5,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,1,5,5,0,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,0].\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,1].\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,5,5,1,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,5,5,1,0,0,0]. Because 1 is at6, 6+4=10 \u2192 no.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,1,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,1,0,0].\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,1,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,1,0].\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,1] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,1].\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 remains the same.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for example0's input row3 had5s which were kept in the output. So this seems correct. However, when comparing to the training example outputs, especially example2's output, this approach may not fit.\n\nIn example2's input, the 2s are in positions (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4), (6,5), (7,6), (8,7). Applying the shift4, each 2 would be placed at original and +4. For example, row1's 2 at0 \u21920 and4. But example2's output for row1 has 2 at0 and4. Yes. Row2's input has2 at1 \u21921 and5. Output row2 has2 at1 and5. Yes. Row3's input has2 at2 \u21922 and6. Output row3 has2 at2 and6. Yes. Row4's input has2 at3 \u21923 and7. Output row4 has2 at3 and7. Yes. Row5's input has2 at4 \u21924 and8. Output row5 has2 at4 and8. Row6's input has2 at5 \u21925 and9. Output row6 has2 at5 and9 (but in example2's output, row6 has 2 at0,5,9. So that doesn't fit. So this suggests that my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nIn example2's output row6, the 2s are at0,5,9. Why? The input's row6 has2 at5. Shift4 would place it at9. So output row6 should have2 at5 and9. But the output has three 2s. So this is conflicting.\n\nAh, but example2's input row6 is [0,0,0,5,5,2,0,0,0,0]. Applying the shift4 to the 2 at5 gives9. So output row6 would have2 at5 and9. But the actual output has2 at0,5,9. Where does the0 come from? Perhaps there's another 2 in the input that affects this row. For example, input row2 has2 at1. Shift4 would place it at5. So in output row2, 2 at1 and5. Then output row6's2 at5 could come from input row2's shift. But how?\n\nThis suggests that the pattern involves not just the same row, but multiple rows. For example, each output rowi is the combination of input rowi and input rowi-4. For example, output row6 is input row6 and input row2. input row2 has2 at1. Shifted4 would be5. So output row6 has2 at5 (from row6's input 2 at5) and1+4=5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rowi contains the elements from input rowi and input rowi-4. For example, output row6 would include input row6's elements and input row2's elements. So input row2 has2 at1. So output row6 would have2 at1+4=5. So output row6 has2 at5 (from row2's 2) and row6's 2 at5 shifted to9. But example2's output row6 has2 at0,5,9. So this still doesn't explain the 2 at0.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that each non-5 element is duplicated with a shift of4 columns to the right in the same row. For the test input, this would mean each 1 is at original and +4.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,1,5,5,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,5,5,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,1,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,1]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis matches the initial hypothesis. However, example2's output doesn't fit this pattern, so there might be another layer to the pattern. For instance, perhaps when there's a 5 in the same row, the shift is adjusted. But without more examples, it's hard to tell. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern in the training examples to apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 7s along the diagonal. The output also has 7s, but there are additional 7s shifted in some way. Looking at the input rows:\n\nRow 0: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n...\nRow 3: [0,0,0,7,5,5,0,...]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,7,5,0,...]\n\nThe output has 7s in the diagonal and also some 7s shifted four positions to the right. For instance, row 0 in the output is [7,0,0,0,7,0,...], which is the original 7 and another at position 4. Then row 1 has 7 at position 1 and 5. It looks like each original 7 is copied to a position four places to the right, creating another diagonal. But how does that work for the lower rows? The original diagonal is still present, and the new shifted 7s form a second diagonal starting from column 4. So for each 7 in the input, the output has two 7s: one in the original position and another shifted four columns to the right. But wait, maybe it's not all 7s. Looking at row 3 of the input, there's 7 followed by 5,5. The output for row 3 is [0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,...]. So the 7 is at position 3 and 7. So the shift is by 4. 3 +4 =7. So for each 7 in the input at position i in row r, there's another 7 at position i+4. But how does this apply when there's a 5 in the input? Maybe the 5s are part of a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has 9s and 5s. The output seems to create a diagonal of 9s starting from row 0, column 5. But the output rows after that have 9s shifted in a way. Let's see: the first row of input is [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,...], and the output is the same. Then input row 1 is [0,0,0,0,0,5,9,0,...], output row 1 becomes [9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,...]. So the 9 from input row 1 (position 6) is now at position 0 and 6 in the output? Or maybe the 9s are being moved to start a new diagonal. The output's first row has 9 at position 0 and 6. Hmm. The original 9 in the input is in row 0, column 5. In the output, row 0 remains the same. Then row 1 in the output has 9 at 0 and 6. Row 2 has 9 at 1 and 7, etc. It looks like the 9s in the input are being transformed into a diagonal that starts at row 0, column 5 and another diagonal that starts at row 1, column 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being replaced by 9s shifted. For example, in input row 1, the 5 is at position 5, and the output has a 9 at position 0. That might not make sense. Alternatively, looking at the output, the 9s form two diagonals: one starting at (0,5) and another starting at (1,0), (2,1), etc. So for each 9 in the input, it's part of a diagonal that's shifted upwards. Wait, in example 1, the input's first non-zero row (row 0) has a 9 at column 5. The output's row 0 has that 9. Then row 1 of the output has a 9 at column 0 and 6. So maybe each 9 in the input is creating a new diagonal. For example, the first 9 in row 0, column 5 remains. The other 9s in the input (rows 1-4) are transformed into a new diagonal that starts at row 1, column 0, and each subsequent row increments the column by 1. So the output's rows 1-5 have 9s forming a diagonal from (1,0) to (5,4), then another set from (0,5) onwards. So perhaps the transformation involves taking the original numbers (like 9) and creating a new diagonal that starts from the first occurrence, shifted left by 5 columns and up by 1 row? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs. For each example, the output seems to have the original diagonal elements and another set of elements shifted. For example, in example 0, the original 7s are on the main diagonal, and another set of 7s are shifted four columns to the right. So for each row, the 7 in column i is also placed at column i+4. But if i+4 exceeds the row length, maybe it wraps or stops. But in example 0, the original 7s are in columns 0-9 (since it's 10x10), so adding 4 would make columns 4-9. For example, row 0's 7 is at column 0 and 4. Row 1's 7 is at column 1 and 5, etc. But looking at the output of example 0, rows 0-5 have two 7s each (columns i and i+4). Then rows 6-9 have only the original 7. So maybe when i+4 is beyond the array, it's not added. For example, row 4: original 7 is at column 4, adding 4 would be column 8. So row 4 has 7 at 4 and 8. Wait in example 0's output, row 4 is [0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0]. Oh right, so 4+4=8. So yes, each row's 7 is duplicated at +4 columns. But only if the new column is within the array (since the array is 10 columns). So that's a possible pattern.\n\nIn example 1, the input has 9s starting at row 0 column 5, then row 1 column 6, etc. But in the output, these 9s are part of the original diagonal, and then new 9s are added starting from row 1 column 0, row 2 column 1, etc. So for each 9 in the input, maybe the output adds a new 9 shifted 5 columns to the left and down by 1 row. Wait, the input's 9 in row 0, column 5 becomes the same in output. Then the input's 9 in row 1, column 6 (original) would be part of the new diagonal in the output. But the output's row 1 has a 9 at column 0 and 6. Hmm. Maybe the pattern here is that for each 9 in the input, the output creates a new 9 at (row -1, column -5). But for row 0, column 5, that would be ( -1, 0), which is invalid. So perhaps the 9s in the input are part of two diagonals in the output: the original and a new one shifted left by 5 and up by 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, in example 1's output, the 9s form two diagonals. The first starts at (0,5) and continues down-right. The second starts at (1,0) and continues down-right. So for each 9 in the input, perhaps the output creates a new 9 at a position shifted left by 5 and up by 1. For example, the input 9 in row 0, column 5 is kept, and a new 9 is placed at (row 0 -1 +1 =0, column 5 -5=0). Wait, but row 0-1 is -1, which is invalid. Maybe not. Alternatively, the output's new diagonal starts at (1,0) for the first occurrence. The input's first 9 is at (0,5). The output's first new 9 is at (1,0). Then each subsequent 9 in the input (row 1, column 6) would create a new 9 at (2,1), etc. So for each 9 in the input at (r, c), output has (r+1, c-5). But that would require that c >=5. So for the input's 9 in row 0, column 5: (0+1,5-5)= (1,0). Yes, that matches the output's row 1, column 0. The next 9 in input is row 1, column 6: (2,1). And so on. So that seems to fit. So the output includes the original 9s and adds a new 9 at (r+1, c-5) if possible. Then the output's 9s are along the original diagonal (row 0-4, columns 5-9) and along the new diagonal (rows 1-5, columns 0-4). \n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the input has 2s along a diagonal. The output seems to create a pattern where each 2 is copied to the position shifted by 3 columns to the left and up by some rows? Let's check. The input's 2s are in rows 1-8. The output has 2s in two diagonals. For example, row 0 of output has 2 at column 3. Row 1 has 2 at 0 and 4. Hmm, perhaps the pattern is similar but with a different shift. Alternatively, in example 2's input, the 2s are in a diagonal, but there's a 5,5 in some rows. The output seems to have the original 2s and a new diagonal of 2s shifted left by 3 columns. Let's see: original 2 in row 1, column 0. Output row 1 has 2 at 0 and 4. Wait, that's a shift of +4? No. Original 2 in row 1, column 0. Output row 1 has 2 at 0 and 4. So shift by 4. But then row 2 input has 2 at column 1. Output row 2 has 2 at 1 and 5. So shift by 4 again. But in example 0, the shift was +4. So maybe the shift amount depends on the example. For example 0, shift 4. Example 1, shift left by 5. Example 2, shift by 4 again? Or maybe the shift is determined by the position of the non-zero elements in the input.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the general pattern across examples. Each example's output has two diagonals. The first is the original diagonal from the input, and the second is a shifted diagonal. The shift seems to be based on the position where the original number is found. For example, in example 0, the 7s are along the main diagonal, and the shifted 7s are four positions to the right. In example 1, the 9s are shifted left by 5 positions. In example 2, the 2s are shifted right by 3 positions (original at column 0, shifted to 3; original at 1 shifted to 4, etc.).\n\nWait, let me check example 2's input and output. Input row 1 is [2,0,0,0,...], output row 1 is [2,0,0,0,2,0,...]. So original 2 at column 0, shifted to column 4 (difference +4). Input row 2 is [0,2,0,0,...], output row 2 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,...]. Shifted by +4. Input row 3 has 2 at column 2. Output row3 has 2 at 2 and 6. So 2+4=6. Similarly, row4 input has 2 at column3. Output row4: 2 at 3 and 7 (3+4=7). So the shift is +4 columns. So the pattern seems to be that for each element in the input, if it's a certain value (like 7,9,2), it's duplicated 4 columns to the right. But in example1, the shift is different. Wait example1's input has 9s starting at column5. In the output, the 9s are also at column0 in row1, which is 5 positions left. So the shift here is -5 columns. So why is the shift different for each example?\n\nHmm, maybe the shift depends on the value. For example, 7 shifted +4, 9 shifted -5, 2 shifted +4. But that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, the shift is determined by the position where the original element is first found. For example, in example0, the first 7 is at column0. The shifted ones are at column0+4=4. So the shift is +4. In example1, the first 9 is at column5, and the shifted ones are at column0, which is 5-5=0. So shift is -5. In example2, the first 2 is at column0, shifted to 0+4=4. So same as example0. That would suggest that the shift is (10 - original column) - something. Wait, perhaps the shift is such that the shifted element is placed to the right by (current column + shift) modulo 10. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is determined by the number of positions from the original column to the edge of the array. For example, in example0, the 7 in column0 has 9 columns to the right. So shifting by 4 would be halfway? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the shift is the value of the element modulo something. For 7, 7 mod 10 is 7, but the shift is 4. For 9, 9 mod 10 is 9, but shift is -5. For 2, shift is +4. Doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is determined by the first occurrence of the number. For example, in example0, the first 7 is in row0, column0. Then the shift is 4, which is the column index (0) +4. Wait, 0+4=4. So for each 7 in column c, the shifted position is c +4. But why 4? Maybe the shift is 4 columns regardless. So for all elements in the input, if they are part of the main diagonal (like 7, 2, 9), they are shifted by a fixed number of columns. But the fixed number varies per example. For example0, shift is +4. Example1, shift is -5. Example2, shift is +4 again. That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is determined by the first occurrence of the element. For example, in example0, the first 7 is in column0. Then the shift is 4. In example1, the first 9 is in column5. The shift is -5 (so that the new position is column0). In example2, the first 2 is in column0, shift +4. So the shift is (10 - original column) - something. Wait 10 -5=5. So in example1, the shift is -5. So maybe the shift is (10 - original column) for elements in the first occurrence. Hmm, example0's first 7 is in column0, 10-0=10. So shift is 4. Not matching. Alternatively, the shift is (10 - original column -1). For example0: 10-0-1=9, which is not 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is determined by the number of 5s in the input. For example, example0's input has 5s in rows3 and4. But how that would affect the shift. Not sure.\n\nLet's look at the test input. The test input has 1s and 5s. The 1s are along a diagonal. For example, row0: 1 at column1. row1:1 at column2. row2:1 at column3. row3:1 at column4. row4:1 at column5. row5:1 at column6. row6:1 at column7. row7:1 at column8. row8:1 at column9. And 5s are in the surrounding positions. So what's the pattern here?\n\nThe output needs to have the 1s duplicated with a certain shift. Looking at the training examples, perhaps the shift is determined by the first occurrence's column. For example, in the test input, the first 1 is in row0, column1. Then the shift would be 4 (like example0 and 2) or maybe some other number. Let's see. If shift is +4, then the first 1 (column1) would be duplicated at column1+4=5. So row0 would have 1 at 1 and 5. Then row1's original 1 is at column2, shifted to 6. Row2's 1 at3 shifted to7. etc. Let's see if that makes sense. But looking at the training examples, in example2, the first 2 is at column0, shifted by +4. So applying that to the test input, each 1 would be duplicated +4 columns. Let's see:\n\nRow0: original 1 at column1. Shifted to 5. So output row0 would be [0,1,0,0,0,1,...].\n\nRow1: original 1 at column2. Shifted to6. So output row1: [0,0,1,5,5,0,1,...]. But in the input, row1 has 5s in columns3 and4. But maybe the output replaces those 5s with 1s. Wait, but in example0, the 5s are left as is. Hmm. Wait example0's input had 5s, but the output only had 7s. So the 5s are part of the input but not transformed. So maybe the transformation only affects the main diagonal elements (like 7,9,2,1) and duplicates them with a shift, leaving other numbers (5) as is.\n\nSo applying this to the test input: each 1 is duplicated 4 columns to the right. Let's see:\n\nOriginal 1s positions (row, column):\n\n0:1\n1:2\n2:3\n3:4\n4:5\n5:6\n6:7\n7:8\n8:9\n\nShifted by +4:\n\n0:1\u21925\n1:2\u21926\n2:3\u21927\n3:4\u21928\n4:5\u21929 (but column9 is valid)\n5:6\u219210 (invalid, so maybe not added)\n6:7\u219211 (invalid)\n7:8\u219212 (invalid)\n8:9\u219213 (invalid)\nSo for row0, shifted 1 is at column5. Row1:6. Row2:7. Row3:8. Row4:9. Rows5-8: shifted positions beyond 9, so not added. So the output should have, for each row with a 1, two 1s: original and shifted. But let's check the test input's rows:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,1,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,5,5,1,0,0,0]\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,1,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,1,0]\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,1]\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo applying the shift of +4:\n\nRow0: 1 at 1 \u2192 add at 1+4=5. So output row0 becomes [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: 1 at 2 \u2192 2+4=6. So output row1 would have 1 at 2 and 6. But the input row1 has 5s in columns3 and4. So output would be [0,0,1,5,5,0,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: 1 at3 \u21927. Output row2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,0].\n\nRow3:1 at4 \u21928. Output row3: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nRow4:1 at5 \u21929. Output row4: [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,1].\n\nRow5:1 at6 \u219210 (invalid), so only original at6. Output row5: [0,0,0,0,5,5,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow6:1 at7 \u219211 (invalid), so original at7. Output row6: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,1,0,0].\n\nRow7:1 at8 \u219212 invalid. Output row7: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,1,0].\n\nRow8:1 at9 \u219213 invalid. Output row8: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,1].\n\nRow9 remains all zeros.\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, for example0, the shifted 7s are added even if the original row is beyond a certain point. For example, in example0's input, row6 has a 7 at column6, and in the output, row6 has only the original 7. Because 6+4=10, which is beyond the array. So the shifted 7 is not added. Similarly, for the test input's rows0-4, the shifted 1s are added, but rows5-8 have shifted positions beyond the array, so only the original 1 remains.\n\nBut looking at example2's output, row5 has [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2]. Wait, the original 2 in row5 would be at column5. Shifting by +4 would be column9, so row5's output has 2 at5 and9. Which is valid. So the shift is possible even for higher columns.\n\nWait, in example2's input, row5 is [0,0,0,5,2,0,0,0,0,0], original 2 at column4. Shifted by +4 would be column8. So output row5: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. Wait, but example2's output for row5 is [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Wait maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait in example2's input, the 2s are in rows:\n\nRow1: column0.\n\nRow2: column1.\n\nRow3: column2.\n\nRow4: column3.\n\nRow5: column4 (because input row5 is [0,0,0,5,2,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow6: column5 (input row6: [0,0,0,5,5,2,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow7: column6.\n\nRow8: column7.\n\nRow9: column8.\n\nWait, no. Let me check example2's input again:\n\nInput for example2:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: [0,0,2,5,5,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,5,2,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,5,5,2,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,5,5,5,2,0,0,0].\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0].\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nSo the 2s are in:\n\nRow1: column0.\n\nRow2: column1.\n\nRow3: column2.\n\nRow4: column3.\n\nRow5: column4.\n\nRow6: column5.\n\nRow7: column6.\n\nRow8: column7.\n\nRow9: column8.\n\nSo in example2's output, the shifted 2s are at original column +4. For example:\n\nRow1's 2 at0 \u21920+4=4. So output row1 would have 2 at0 and4. But example2's output row1 is [2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nYes. Row5's 2 is at4 \u21924+4=8. So output row5 would have 2 at4 and8. But example2's output row5 is [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. Which matches.\n\nAh, I see. So for example2, the shift is +4 columns. So for the test input, the shift should be +4 columns. But the test input's first 1 is at column1, so shifted to5. Let's proceed.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the output would have two 1s in rows where the shifted position is within the array. Let's construct each row:\n\nRow0: Original 1 at1, shifted to5. Output: [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: Original 1 at2, shifted to6. Input has 5s at3,4. So output: [0,0,1,5,5,0,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: Original 1 at3, shifted to7. Output: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,0].\n\nRow3: Original 1 at4, shifted to8. Output: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nRow4: Original 1 at5, shifted to9. Output: [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,1].\n\nRow5: Original 1 at6, shifted to10 (invalid). So output: [0,0,0,0,5,5,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow6: Original 1 at7, shifted to11 (invalid). So output: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,1,0,0].\n\nRow7: Original 1 at8, shifted to12 (invalid). Output: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,1,0].\n\nRow8: Original 1 at9, shifted to13 (invalid). Output: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,1].\n\nRow9: All zeros remain.\n\nSo combining all these rows, the output would be as described. But need to check if there's any other pattern. For example, in example2's output, there's a row0 with 2 at3. How did that happen? Let's look. Example2's input row0 is all zeros, but output row0 has 2 at3. So that's different. How?\n\nWait example2's input row0 is all zeros. But output row0 is [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Where does this 2 come from? Ah, maybe the shift wraps around or there's another pattern. For example, maybe the shift is not just within the same row. Let me re-examine example2's input and output.\n\nIn example2's input, row0 is all zeros. Output row0 has 2 at column3. But where does this 2 come from? Looking at the input, the first 2 is in row1, column0. In the output, row1 has 2 at0 and4. But row0's 2 at3 must be coming from somewhere else. This suggests that the shift isn't just a simple +4 in the same row. So my earlier assumption might be incorrect.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let me look again at example2's input and output. \n\nExample2's output row0: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut in the input, row0 has no elements. So where is this 2 coming from? Looking at other rows. The input's row3 has [0,0,2,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row3 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]. So the 2 in column2 and6. Original 2 at column2, shifted to6. So the shift is +4. But how does row0's 2 appear?\n\nLooking at other rows in the output:\n\nRow4 input: [0,0,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row4: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So 2 at3 and7. So original 2 at3, shifted to7 (+4).\n\nBut then, row0's 2 in output at3. How does that happen? There's no 2 in the input's row0.\n\nWait maybe the shift is not just within the same row. Maybe the shift is applied across rows. For example, in example2's output, the 2 at row0 column3 could be a shifted 2 from a previous row. But how?\n\nLooking at input row1 has 2 at column0. Output row1 has 2 at0 and4. Output row0 has 2 at3. So perhaps the shift is not only +4 columns, but also -1 row. For example, the 2 from input row1 column0 is placed in row0 column0+4=4, but no. Row0's output has 2 at3. Alternatively, maybe it's a diagonal shift. For example, each 2 is shifted diagonally down and right by 3. Let's see:\n\nOriginal 2 in row1, column0. Shifted to row0, column3. So row-1, column+3. But that doesn't fit for other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where the shifted elements form a diagonal that starts from a certain point. For example, in example2's output, the shifted 2s form a diagonal starting at row0 column3, row1 column4, row2 column5, etc. So the shift is row+0, column+3. Or perhaps the shift is (row -1, column +3). For example, the original 2 in row1 column0 would shift to row0 column3. Original 2 in row2 column1 \u2192 row1 column4. Yes, that would align with example2's output.\n\nLet's check:\n\nInput row1: 2 at0. Output row0:3.\n\nInput row2:2 at1. Output row1:4.\n\nInput row3:2 at2. Output row2:5.\n\nInput row4:2 at3. Output row3:6.\n\nInput row5:2 at4. Output row4:7.\n\nInput row6:2 at5. Output row5:8.\n\nInput row7:2 at6. Output row6:9.\n\nInput row8:2 at7. Output row7:10 (invalid).\n\nInput row9:2 at8. Output row8:11 (invalid).\n\nSo this would explain the output of example2. The original 2 in row r, column c is duplicated at row r-1, column c+3. So for example, input row1 (r=1, c=0) \u2192 output row0, c=3. So row0's 2 comes from input row1's 2. Similarly, input row2's 2 (r=2, c=1) \u2192 output row1, c=4. Yes, that fits example2's output. For example, output row0 has 2 at3 (from row1's 2), output row1 has 2 at0 and4 (original row1's 2 and row2's 2 shifted to row1). Wait no, in output row1: 2 at0 and4. The 2 at0 is the original from input row1. The 2 at4 comes from input row2's 2 shifted to row1, column1+3=4. Oh right. So each 2 in the input is both kept in its original position and added to row-1, column+3.\n\nAh, so the pattern is: for each element in the input (like 7,9,2,1), if it's part of the main diagonal (or some other pattern), then in the output, the element is duplicated in a new position that is shifted up by one row and to the right by three columns. But how does this vary between examples?\n\nWait in example0:\n\nOriginal 7 in row0, column0. If shifted up by1 row (invalid) and right by3 columns \u2192 column3. But example0's output row0 has 7 at0 and4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this approach may not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example0's output, the shifted 7s are in the same row but 4 columns to the right. Example2's output has shifted 2s in the same row and 4 columns to the right for some rows, but for row0, it's shifted from row1. So maybe there's a combination of shifts. Perhaps for the first few rows, the shift is applied within the same row, but for others, it's applied across rows. This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for another pattern. In all examples, the output has two diagonals. The original diagonal and another diagonal that is offset. The offset could be a fixed number of columns. For example:\n\nExample0: original diagonal of 7s, and another diagonal starting at column4, row0. So the offset is +4 columns.\n\nExample1: original diagonal of9s starting at column5, and another diagonal starting at column0, row1. So the offset is -5 columns and +1 row.\n\nExample2: original diagonal of2s, and another diagonal starting at column3, row0. So the offset is +3 columns and -1 row.\n\nBut how to determine the offset. It seems that the offset is such that the new diagonal starts at a position based on the original element's first occurrence. For example:\n\nIn example0, the first 7 is at row0 column0. The new diagonal starts at row0 column4. So offset +4 columns.\n\nIn example1, first 9 is at row0 column5. The new diagonal starts at row1 column0. So row+1, column-5.\n\nIn example2, first 2 is at row1 column0. The new diagonal starts at row0 column3. So row-1, column+3.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe the offset is determined by the value of the element. For example, 7 \u21924, 9\u21925, 2\u21923. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the offset is the value of the element minus some base. For example, 7-3=4. 9-4=5. 2-(-1)=3. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the number of letters in the English word for the number. Seven has 5 letters, but 4 is the offset. Nine has4 letters, offset5. Two has3 letters, offset3. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the offset is the digit's position in the alphabet. S is 19, but 7 is the number. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the offset is the number of other elements in the input. For example, in example0, there are 5s in some rows, but I don't see how that would affect the offset.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a commonality between the examples.\n\nIn example0:\n\nOriginal diagonal elements (7) are copied to the same row, shifted +4.\n\nIn example1:\n\nOriginal diagonal elements (9) are copied to a new diagonal shifted down by1 row and left by5 columns.\n\nIn example2:\n\nOriginal diagonal elements (2) are copied to a new diagonal shifted up by1 row and right by3 columns.\n\nBut why different shifts?\n\nLooking at the positions of the first occurrence of the element:\n\nExample0: first7 at (0,0). Shifted to (0,4).\n\nExample1: first9 at (0,5). Shifted to (1,0).\n\nExample2: first2 at (1,0). Shifted to (0,3).\n\nSo the shift for the new diagonal is:\n\nFor example0: same row, column+4.\n\nFor example1: row+1, column-5.\n\nFor example2: row-1, column+3.\n\nThis seems arbitrary. Maybe the shift is such that the new diagonal starts at column (original column + some value) modulo 10. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the new diagonal starts at a position that is (original column + shift) where the shift is 4 for examples0 and2, and -5 for example1. But why?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output diagonals. For example0, the new diagonal starts at column4. Example1's new diagonal starts at column0. Example2's new diagonal starts at column3. What's common between 4,0,3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is such that the new diagonal is placed in the middle of the array. For a 10x10 grid, the middle is around column5. So example0's new diagonal starts at4, example1's at0, example2's at3. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is determined by the first occurrence's column. For example:\n\nIn example0, first column0: shift+4 \u21924.\n\nIn example1, first column5: shift-5 \u21920.\n\nIn example2, first column0: shift+3 \u21923.\n\nBut why these shifts? 0+4=4,5-5=0,0+3=3. Maybe the shift is 10 - first column -1. For example0:10-0-1=9. No. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is first column's value multiplied by some number. For example0:0*4=0\u2192 but shift is4. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Let's try to find a different pattern.\n\nLooking at example0's output: the 7s are in two diagonals. The first is the main diagonal (row i, column i), the second is (row i, column i+4). So for row i, column j = i+4.\n\nExample1's output has 9s in two diagonals: (row i, column i+5) and (row i+1, column i).\n\nWait, in example1's output:\n\nRow0:9 at5.\n\nRow1:9 at0 and6.\n\nRow2:9 at1 and7.\n\nRow3:9 at2 and8.\n\nRow4:9 at3 and9.\n\nRow5:9 at4.\n\nRow6:9 at5.\n\nRow7:9 at6.\n\nRow8:9 at7.\n\nRow9:9 at8.\n\nSo the two diagonals are:\n\n1. Original: (i, 5+i) for i from0 to4 (rows0-4).\n\nBut rows0-4 in the input have 9s starting from row0 column5. Output's original diagonal is the same.\n\n2. New diagonal: (i+1, i) for i from0 to4 (rows1-5, columns0-4).\n\nThen rows5-9 have 9s continuing the original diagonal (columns5-9).\n\nSo for example1's input, the 9s in the input are shifted to form a new diagonal starting at row1, column0, and so on.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation involves taking the original diagonal elements and creating a new diagonal that starts one row below and five columns to the left. But why five? Because the original first occurrence was at column5. So maybe the shift is (row+1, column-5). For example, the 9 in row0, column5 is moved to row1, column0. The 9 in row1, column6 is moved to row2, column1. Etc.\n\nSimilarly, example2's new diagonal starts at row0, column3. The first 2 in the input is at row1, column0. So shift (row-1, column+3). So original (1,0) becomes (0,3). Next input 2 at row2, column1 \u2192 output (1,4). Etc.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each element in the input's diagonal, create a new element in the output at (row - (original column of first occurrence), column - (original column of first occurrence))? Not sure. Alternatively, the shift is determined by the column of the first occurrence. For example, if the first occurrence is at column c, then the new diagonal is shifted by ( -c columns and +1 row). For example1, first occurrence at c=5. New diagonal is shifted by -5 columns and +1 row. For example0, first occurrence at c=0. Shifted by +0 columns and +0 rows? No. Because example0's new diagonal is in the same row, shifted +4 columns.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is (new_row = original_row - (original_column), new_col = original_col + (some value)). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shift in columns is the same for each example. For example0, +4; example1, -5; example2, +3. How are these numbers determined? 7-3=4, 9-4=5, 2-(-1)=3. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is determined by the number of rows between the first and last occurrence of the element. For example0, the first 7 is at row0, last at row9. 9-0=9. 9-5=4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is determined by the number of times the element appears. For example0, 7 appears 10 times. 10-6=4. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to focus on the test input. The test input has 1s forming a diagonal from row0 column1 to row8 column9. The 5s are around them. The output needs to have two diagonals of 1s. How?\n\nLooking at the training examples, perhaps the shift is +4 columns. So for the test input's 1s:\n\nRow0, column1 \u21921+4=5. So new 1 at5.\n\nRow1, column2 \u21922+4=6.\n\nRow2, column3 \u21923+4=7.\n\nRow3, column4 \u21924+4=8.\n\nRow4, column5 \u21925+4=9.\n\nRow5, column6 \u21926+4=10 (invalid).\n\nSo rows0-4 will have two 1s each. Rows5-8 will have one 1 each.\n\nBut in example2, the shift was +4, and the output included the new elements even when they wrapped around, but in example2's case, there were shifts across rows. But perhaps for the test input, it's a simple +4 shift within the same row.\n\nBut looking at example2's output, row0 has a 2 at3. That must come from row1's 2 shifted. So maybe the shift is not only within the same row but also across rows. So for example, when the shifted column exceeds the row length, it wraps to the next row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the shift is a fixed number of columns to the right, and if it exceeds, it starts from the beginning of the next row. But this complicates things.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll proceed with the assumption that the pattern is to shift each element in the input's diagonal by 4 columns to the right in the same row, and if that's possible, add it there, leaving other elements (like 5s) as is. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,1,5,5,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,5,5,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,1,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,1]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, example2's output has shifted elements that appear in previous rows. For example, the 2 in row0 comes from row1's 2 shifted. So perhaps the shift is not within the same row but to the row above and shifted by3.\n\nFor the test input, this would mean:\n\nFor each 1 in row r, column c, add a 1 at row r-1, column c+3.\n\nSo for the test input's first 1 at row0 column1: shifted to row-1 (invalid) \u2192 no addition.\n\nBut example2's first 2 is at row1 column0, shifted to row0 column3. So (1-1=0, 0+3=3).\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0's 1 at1: no shift (row-1 invalid).\n\nRow1's 1 at2: shifted to row0, 2+3=5. So output row0 gets a 1 at5.\n\nRow2's 1 at3: shifted to row1,3+3=6.\n\nRow3's 1 at4: shifted to row2,4+3=7.\n\nRow4's 1 at5: shifted to row3,5+3=8.\n\nRow5's 1 at6: shifted to row4,6+3=9.\n\nRow6's 1 at7: shifted to row5,7+3=10 (invalid).\n\nRow7's 1 at8: shifted to row6,8+3=11 (invalid).\n\nRow8's 1 at9: shifted to row7,9+3=12 (invalid).\n\nSo the shifted 1s would be:\n\nRow0:5 (from row1's 1).\n\nRow1:6 (from row2's 1).\n\nRow2:7 (from row3's 1).\n\nRow3:8 (from row4's 1).\n\nRow4:9 (from row5's 1).\n\nRows5-7: no shifted 1s.\n\nSo the output rows would have:\n\nRow0: original 1 at1, plus shifted 1 from row1 at5. So [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: original 1 at2, plus shifted 1 from row2 at6. So [0,0,1,5,5,0,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: original 1 at3, plus shifted 1 from row3 at7. So [0,0,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,0].\n\nRow3: original 1 at4, plus shifted 1 from row4 at8. So [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nRow4: original 1 at5, plus shifted 1 from row5 at9. So [0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,1].\n\nRows5-8: only original 1s.\n\nThis matches the earlier assumption. However, in example2's output, the shifted elements also appear in the same row. For example, input row1's 2 is at0, shifted to row0's3. But output row1 also has a 2 at4. Where does that come from?\n\nAh, because in example2, each 2 is duplicated both in the same row (shifted +4) and in the previous row (shifted +3). That complicates things. But given time constraints and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the first pattern: shifting each element in the same row by +4 columns. \n\nThe final answer for the test input would thus be:\n\n[0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1,5,5,0,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0,0,5,5,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,5,5,5,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,1]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]",
