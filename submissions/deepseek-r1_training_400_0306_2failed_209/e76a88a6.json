        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn the input of Example 0, there are blocks of numbers like 2, 4, and 5. The output seems to have the same structure but some numbers are changed. For instance, the 5s in the input become 2s, 4s, etc. Let me check the positions. The 5 blocks in the lower part of the input become 2, 4, 4 in the output. Similarly, the 2 and 4 blocks in the upper part are transformed but maybe rotated or something.\n\nWait, maybe it's a rotation of the blocks. Like, each contiguous block of the same number is rotated 90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise. Let me see. In the input of Example 0, the 5s form a vertical block in the middle right. In the output, they become a horizontal block in the bottom, but transformed to 2s. Wait, no. Let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 5s are arranged in a 3x3 vertical block starting at row 4, column 6. Then in the output, those become 2,4,4 in subsequent rows. Hmm, maybe the values are being transformed based on their positions after a rotation. Alternatively, perhaps each block is being shifted in a certain way, and the numbers are being replaced by the next lower even number? Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has 5s and 6s, 8s. The output transforms the 5s into 6,8,8, etc. Wait, in the first row of the input, there's a 5,5,5,5 which in the output becomes 6,6,6,6. Then in the next row, the 5s become 8,8,6,8. Hmm. Maybe the numbers are being replaced by neighboring numbers from adjacent blocks? Or perhaps there's a cycle where 5 becomes 6, 6 becomes 8, etc. Wait, in Example 0, 5 becomes 2. But in Example 1, 5 becomes 6. That might not fit. So maybe not a simple cycle.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the structure of the blocks. In Example 0, the 5s form three vertical lines in the input. In the output, those same positions now have 2s, but arranged horizontally. Maybe each block is rotated, and the numbers are decremented by 3 (since 5-3=2). But in Example 1, 5 becomes 6, which is +1. That doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each block of a number is shifted in a certain direction, and the number itself is replaced based on the direction of the shift. For example, if a block is moved to the right, the number increases by 1. But I need to check the examples.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 5s are in the middle right. In the output, they become 2s. So 5 -> 2. That's a decrease by 3. Then in Example 1, the 5s in the first row become 6s. So 5 ->6, which is +1. That doesn't fit the same pattern. So maybe the number transformation depends on something else.\n\nLooking at the positions of the blocks. In Example 0, the output for the 5 blocks is in the same area but rotated. For instance, the vertical 5s in rows 4-6, columns 7-9 become horizontal blocks in the output. Similarly, the 2s and 4s in the upper left are transformed. Maybe the blocks are rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the numbers are adjusted based on their new position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each block is replaced by the next lower even number. For example, 5 (odd) becomes 4 (even), but in Example 0, 5 becomes 2, which is lower. Wait, in Example 0, 5 becomes 2, which is a drop of 3. 2 is even. 4 in the input (Example 0) stays 4 in some places. Wait, in the third row of input example 0, the 4s become 4s again. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the transformation is that each block is copied but shifted one position to the right, and the number is replaced by the number from the cell to the left. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the structure, maybe each block is replaced by the values from the previous block in a clockwise manner. For example, in Example 0, the upper left blocks (2,4,4) and the lower right blocks (5s) are being rotated. The 5s in the input become 2s in the output, and their positions are shifted. Wait, the 5 blocks in input are in positions:\n\nRows 4-6, columns 7-9 (vertical)\nThen rows 7-9, columns 3-5 (horizontal)\n\nIn the output, the transformed 2s are in rows 4-6, columns 7-9 (same vertical), but in the output for example 0, the 5s become 2,4,4. Wait, maybe each vertical block is converted to a horizontal one, and the number is transformed based on the direction of rotation. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blocks are being shifted in a specific direction, and the numbers are mapped in a certain way. For example, moving each block to the next quadrant, but that's vague.\n\nLet me check the first example again. Example 0's input has a block of 2s in rows 1-3, columns 2-4. The output for those rows has 2,2,2; 2,4,4; 4,4,4. So the middle row of the block is replaced with higher numbers. Then, in the lower 5 blocks, they become 2,4,4 and so on. Maybe it's a matter of taking each block and creating a gradient. For example, the first row of the block remains the same, the second increases by 2, the third increases by 0, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each block is replaced by the sum of adjacent cells. But that's complicated.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the first row has 5s that become 6s in the output. The second row's 5s become 8,8,6,8. The third row's 5s become 6,8,8,8. The input's 5 blocks are transformed into 6, 8, etc. So maybe each 5 is replaced by the number from the cell above it. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's input, first row of 5s (row 0) becomes 6s. The row above (but there's no row above row 0), so maybe the row below. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, in the input of Example 1, the 5 in the first row (columns 6-9) are adjacent to 6s in the row below. The output for those 5s becomes 6. So perhaps each 5 is replaced by the number from the cell above or below. For instance, in the first row's 5s, the row below (row 1) has 5s and 6s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing each number with the next number in a certain sequence. For example, in Example 0, 2 stays 2, 4 stays 4, 5 becomes 2. In Example 1, 5 becomes 6, 6 becomes 8, 8 becomes 6. Wait, that might not form a clear sequence. \n\nAnother angle: Looking at the output of Example 0, the 5s in the input are transformed into 2,4,4. Similarly, in Example 1, the 5s become 6,8, etc. So maybe the transformation is that the value of each cell is replaced by the minimum, maximum, or some function of the original block's values. For instance, in Example 0, the 5s are replaced by 2, which is the value from another block. The upper blocks have 2 and 4, so maybe the 5s are replaced by the values from those upper blocks. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is being mirrored or rotated, and the numbers are adjusted accordingly. For example, rotating the grid 180 degrees. Let me check. In Example 0, the input has a 5 block in the lower right. If rotated 180, that block would be in the upper left. But the output's 2 blocks are in the lower right. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs again. In Example 0, the output seems to have the same structure as the input but with some blocks shifted. The upper 2,4,4 blocks are the same, but the lower 5s become 2,4,4 in a different pattern. Maybe the 5 blocks are being replaced by the same pattern as the 2 blocks. Like, a copy of the upper pattern but scaled down. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each group of the same number is shifted downward or to the right, and the number is changed based on the direction. For example, in Example 0, the 5s are shifted down and become 2s. But I need to check.\n\nAnother idea: The numbers in the output are the numbers that are adjacent (in some direction) to the original numbers in the input. For example, each 5 in the input is replaced by the number to its left or right. Let's check. In Example 0, a 5 in the input's row 4, column 7 would be replaced by 0 (since left is 0, but the output is 2). So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each contiguous block of a number is replaced by another number in a certain order. Like, in Example 0, the first block (2s) stay as 2s, the next (4s) stay 4s, the 5s become 2s. In Example 1, 5s become 6s, 6s become 8s, 8s become 6s. Maybe there's a cycle: 2\u21924\u21925\u21922... or something. But in Example 1, 5\u21926, 6\u21928, 8\u21926. So perhaps the cycle is 5\u21926, 6\u21928, 8\u21926. But Example 0's 5\u21922 doesn't fit that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement depends on the position of the block. For example, blocks in certain quadrants are replaced by different numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, look at the output in Example 0. The 5s in the input are transformed into 2s, 4s. The 2s in the input remain 2s but perhaps in different positions. Maybe each block is transformed into the next lower even number. So 5\u21924, but in Example 0, 5 becomes 2. Hmm. Maybe not.\n\nWait, another approach: looking at the test input. Let's see the test input has numbers 4,1,5. According to the training examples, maybe 4s become 4s, 1s become something, and 5s become another number.\n\nIn Example 0, 5s become 2,4,4. In Example 1, 5s become 6,8, etc. So perhaps the replacement of 5 depends on the neighboring numbers. For example, in Example 0, the 5s are near 0s, so they become 2. In Example 1, the 5s are near 6 and 8, so they become 6 and 8. So maybe each 5 is replaced by the average or the numbers around it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matter of layers. The first layer (upper left in Example 0) has 2s and 4s, and the 5s in the lower part are transformed into the same pattern as the upper layers. Like a mirroring effect. For example, in Example 0's output, the lower 5s become 2s, 4s, similar to the upper blocks. The same in Example 1, where the 5s become 6s and 8s, which are the numbers from the upper blocks.\n\nSo the pattern might be: For each block in the input, replace it with the corresponding block from another part of the grid, possibly rotated or mirrored, and use the numbers from those blocks. For example, the lower right 5s in Example 0 are replaced with the same pattern as the upper left 2s and 4s. Similarly, in Example 1, the 5s are replaced with the pattern from the upper 6s and 8s.\n\nSo, if the input has a block of a certain number, it's replaced by a block from another part of the grid. The numbers are copied from that other block. So the transformation is mirroring or rotating the grid and replacing the original blocks with the mirrored ones.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's lower right 5s are replaced by the upper left 2 and 4 blocks. Let me check:\n\nOriginal upper left block (rows 1-3, columns 2-4) has:\n\nRow1: 2,2,2\n\nRow2:2,4,4\n\nRow3:4,4,4\n\nIn the output, the lower right block (rows 4-6, columns 7-9) becomes:\n\nRow4:0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0\n\nRow5:0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,0\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0\n\nSo the same pattern as the upper left block. Then the lower left 5s in rows7-9 are replaced by the same pattern again. So each 5 block is replaced by the upper left's pattern. So the transformation is that every 5 block is replaced by a copy of the upper left block's pattern.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's input, the upper part has 6s and 8s. The output's lower 5 blocks are replaced by those patterns.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row of 5s becomes 6,6,6,6. The next row's 5s become 8,8,6,8. Then 6,8,8,8. Which matches the upper left blocks in the input, which have:\n\nRow1:6,6,6,6\n\nRow2:8,8,6,8\n\nRow3:6,8,8,8\n\nSo the 5 blocks are replaced by the upper left blocks' patterns. So the pattern is that all occurrences of a certain number (like 5) are replaced by the pattern from the upper left blocks of the input. So the transformation is taking the upper left blocks (maybe the first three rows) and using their patterns to replace other blocks of numbers (like 5s).\n\nSo, the rule could be: Identify all contiguous blocks of a certain number (like 5) and replace each such block with the corresponding block from the upper left part of the grid. The numbers in the replaced block are copied from the upper left block's corresponding positions.\n\nIn Example 0, the upper left block is 2,2,2; 2,4,4; 4,4,4. The 5 blocks are replaced with this same structure. Similarly, in Example 1, the upper left blocks (rows 1-3) are 6,6,6,6; 8,8,6,8; 6,8,8,8, and the 5 blocks are replaced with these values.\n\nSo, for the test input, the same approach applies. The test input has blocks of 4,1,5. The upper left blocks would be the first few rows. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0:0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1:0,1,4,4,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow2:0,1,4,1,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow3:0,1,1,1,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRows 0-3: The upper left block here is the 4s in row0, columns1-3, then rows1-3 have 1s and 4s. Let's see:\n\nRow0: 4,4,4 (columns 1-3)\n\nRow1: 1,4,4 (columns1-3)\n\nRow2:1,4,1 (columns1-3)\n\nRow3:1,1,1 (columns1-3)\n\nSo the upper left block is a 4x3 block (rows0-3, columns1-3) with values:\n\nRow0:4,4,4\n\nRow1:1,4,4\n\nRow2:1,4,1\n\nRow3:1,1,1\n\nThen, in the test input, there are 5 blocks. Let's find where the 5s are:\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow1-3, columns6-8: 5,5,5 in each row.\n\nRow5-8, columns2-4: 5,5,5 in each row.\n\nRow6-8, columns7-9: 5,5,5.\n\nRow9, columns7-9:5,5,5.\n\nSo the 5 blocks are:\n\n- Block A: rows1-3, columns6-8 (each row has 5s here)\n\n- Block B: rows5-8, columns2-4 (rows5-8 have 5s here)\n\n- Block C: rows6-8, columns7-9 (each row has 5s here)\n\n- Block D: row9, columns7-9 (5s here)\n\nAccording to the pattern from the training examples, each 5 block should be replaced by the corresponding upper left block's pattern. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0 and 1, each 5 block is replaced by the upper left block's pattern. So for the test input, each 5 block would be replaced with the pattern from rows0-3, columns1-3.\n\nBut how exactly? Let's see:\n\nThe upper left block is 4 rows (rows0-3) with varying values. But in the training examples, the replacement was done row by row. For example, in Example 0, the upper left block is 3 rows. The 5 block is also 3 rows, so each row of the 5 block is replaced by the corresponding row of the upper left block.\n\nSo, in the test input, the upper left block has 4 rows. Let's see the 5 blocks:\n\nBlock A: rows1-3, columns6-8 (3 rows). The upper left block has rows0-3. So maybe each row of the 5 block (rows1-3) is replaced by rows0-2 of the upper left block.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the upper left block was 3 rows, and the replaced 5 block was 3 rows. Each row of the 5 block was replaced by the corresponding row of the upper left block. Similarly in Example 1.\n\nSo for the test input, Block A (rows1-3) would take rows0-2 of the upper left block. Let's check:\n\nUpper left block rows0-3:\n\nRow0:4,4,4\n\nRow1:1,4,4\n\nRow2:1,4,1\n\nRow3:1,1,1\n\nSo Block A (rows1-3 of input) would be replaced by rows0-2 of the upper left block. Wait, but rows1-3 in the input are being replaced. Let me think: In Example 0, the 5 block started at row4, and the replacement rows were 0-2 (since the upper block was rows1-3). Wait, maybe the replacement is taking the same number of rows as the upper left block. So in test input, the upper left block is rows0-3 (4 rows), but the 5 blocks vary in row count. For example, Block A has 3 rows. So how to handle that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement uses the first N rows of the upper left block, where N is the number of rows in the 5 block.\n\nFor Block A in test input: 3 rows (rows1-3). So take the first 3 rows of the upper left block (rows0-2: 4,4,4; 1,4,4; 1,4,1) and replace the 5s with those values.\n\nSo in the output, the 5s in rows1-3, columns6-8 would become:\n\nRow1:6-8 replaced by 4,4,4\n\nRow2:6-8 replaced by 1,4,4\n\nRow3:6-8 replaced by 1,4,1\n\nBut wait, the upper left block starts at row0, column1. So the replacement values are:\n\nRow0: columns1-3 \u2192 4,4,4\n\nRow1: columns1-3 \u21921,4,4\n\nRow2: columns1-3 \u21921,4,1\n\nRow3: columns1-3 \u21921,1,1\n\nSo for Block A (rows1-3), each row is replaced with the corresponding row from the upper left block's first three rows. So:\n\nRow1 of Block A (input row1) is replaced with row0's values (4,4,4)\n\nRow2 of Block A (input row2) replaced with row1's values (1,4,4)\n\nRow3 of Block A (input row3) replaced with row2's values (1,4,1)\n\nWait, but the rows are offset. For example, in Example 0, the upper left block was rows1-3. The replaced 5 block was rows4-6. The output used the same rows: rows1-3's values became rows4-6's values. So perhaps the replacement uses the same index relative to the upper block.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement cycles through the upper left block's rows. For example, in Example 0, the upper left block had three rows, and the 5 block had three rows. Each row of the 5 block was replaced by the corresponding row of the upper left block. So in test input Block A (3 rows) would use the first three rows of the upper left block (rows0-2). \n\nSimilarly, Block B in the test input is rows5-8 (4 rows). The upper left block has 4 rows (0-3). So each row of the 5 block would be replaced by the corresponding row of the upper left block. For example:\n\nRow5 (5 block) \u2192 row0's upper left values (4,4,4)\n\nRow6 \u2192 row1 (1,4,4)\n\nRow7 \u2192 row2 (1,4,1)\n\nRow8 \u2192 row3 (1,1,1)\n\nThen Block C is rows6-8 (3 rows), columns7-9. This would take rows0-2 of the upper left block again. Similarly, Block D is row9 \u2192 row0 of upper left.\n\nBut let's verify this with the test input.\n\nApplying this pattern:\n\nFor each 5 block in the input:\n\n- Determine the number of rows in the block.\n\n- For each row in the block, replace the 5s with the corresponding row from the upper left block (rows0-3, columns1-3), cycling through if needed.\n\nSo let's go through each 5 block in the test input.\n\nBlock A: rows1-3 (3 rows), columns6-8.\n\nReplace with upper left rows0-2:\n\nRow1 \u2192 row0 (4,4,4)\n\nRow2 \u2192 row1 (1,4,4)\n\nRow3 \u2192 row2 (1,4,1)\n\nSo the output for these rows in columns6-8 becomes:\n\nRow1:5\u21924,4,4\n\nRow2:5\u21921,4,4\n\nRow3:5\u21921,4,1\n\nBlock B: rows5-8 (4 rows), columns2-4.\n\nReplace with upper left rows0-3:\n\nRow5 \u2192 row0 (4,4,4)\n\nRow6 \u2192 row1 (1,4,4)\n\nRow7 \u2192 row2 (1,4,1)\n\nRow8 \u2192 row3 (1,1,1)\n\nSo these rows' columns2-4 become:\n\nRow5:4,4,4\n\nRow6:1,4,4\n\nRow7:1,4,1\n\nRow8:1,1,1\n\nBlock C: rows6-8 (3 rows), columns7-9.\n\nReplace with upper left rows0-2:\n\nRow6 \u2192 row0 (4,4,4)\n\nRow7 \u2192 row1 (1,4,4)\n\nRow8 \u2192 row2 (1,4,1)\n\nSo their columns7-9 become:\n\nRow6:4,4,4\n\nRow7:1,4,4\n\nRow8:1,4,1\n\nBlock D: row9, columns7-9 (1 row). Replace with row0 (4,4,4).\n\nSo row9, columns7-9 becomes 4,4,4.\n\nNow, applying this transformation to the entire test input:\n\nLet's go row by row.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,4,4,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,4,1,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,1,1,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5]\n\nRow7: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5]\n\nRow8: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5]\n\nAfter transformation:\n\nRow0 remains the same.\n\nRow1: Columns6-8 (5,5,5) replaced with 4,4,4 \u2192 [0,1,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow2: Columns6-8 replaced with 1,4,4 \u2192 [0,1,4,1,0,0,1,4,4,0]\n\nRow3: Columns6-8 replaced with 1,4,1 \u2192 [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,4,1,0]\n\nRow4: Columns6-8 (5,5,5) need to check. Wait, row4's columns6-8 are 5s. Are they part of a block? In the test input, rows1-3,4 have 5s in columns6-8. Wait, row4 has 5s in columns6-8. So row4 is part of the same block as rows1-3? Let's see:\n\nOriginal test input:\n\nRow4: 0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0\n\nSo row4's 5s are in columns6-8. The rows1-4 (rows1,2,3,4) all have 5s in columns6-8. So the block is rows1-4, columns6-8 (4 rows). But in our earlier analysis, we considered Block A as rows1-3. But maybe the block is larger. Wait, I need to check for contiguous 5s.\n\nIn row4, the 5s are contiguous in columns6-8. Are they adjacent to the 5s in row3? Yes. So the entire block would be rows1-4, columns6-8. So that's a 4-row block. So when replacing this block, we'd use the upper left block's 4 rows (rows0-3), replacing each row of the 5 block with the corresponding row of the upper left.\n\nSo for row4 (which is row3 in the 5 block), it would be replaced with upper left row3's values (1,1,1).\n\nSo row4's columns6-8 would be 1,1,1.\n\nThen, rows5-8: Block B is rows5-8, columns2-4. Each of those rows has 5s in columns2-4. So replacing them as:\n\nRow5: upper left row0 (4,4,4)\n\nRow6: row1 (1,4,4)\n\nRow7: row2 (1,4,1)\n\nRow8: row3 (1,1,1)\n\nSo their columns2-4 become:\n\nRow5:4,4,4 \u2192 [0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6:1,4,4 \u2192 [0,0,1,4,4,0,0,5,5,5]\n\nWait, but row6 also has 5s in columns7-9 (Block C). So after replacing columns2-4, the 5s in columns7-9 remain. Let's process all blocks.\n\nBlock C is rows6-8, columns7-9. Each row has 5s here. So for row6, columns7-9: replace with upper left row0 (4,4,4).\n\nRow7: columns7-9 replaced with upper left row1 (1,4,4).\n\nRow8: columns7-9 replaced with upper left row2 (1,4,1).\n\nBlock D: row9, columns7-9 replaced with upper left row0 (4,4,4).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nLet's build the output step by step.\n\nOriginal test input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,4,4,0,0,5,5,5,0] \u2192 replace columns6-8 with 4,4,4 \u2192 [0,1,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,4,1,0,0,5,5,5,0] \u2192 replace columns6-8 with 1,4,4 \u2192 [0,1,4,1,0,0,1,4,4,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,1,1,0,0,5,5,5,0] \u2192 replace columns6-8 with 1,4,1 \u2192 [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,4,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0] \u2192 replace columns6-8 with 1,1,1 (upper left row3) \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 replace columns2-4 with 4,4,4 \u2192 [0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5] \u2192 replace columns2-4 with 1,4,4 (upper left row1) and columns7-9 with 4,4,4 (upper left row0) \u2192 [0,0,1,4,4,0,0,4,4,4]\n\nRow7: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5] \u2192 replace columns2-4 with 1,4,1 (upper left row2) and columns7-9 with 1,4,4 (upper left row1) \u2192 [0,0,1,4,1,0,0,1,4,4]\n\nRow8: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5] \u2192 replace columns2-4 with 1,1,1 (upper left row3) and columns7-9 with 1,4,1 (upper left row2) \u2192 [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,4,1]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5] \u2192 replace columns7-9 with 4,4,4 (upper left row0) \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4]\n\nPutting all these together, the output should be:\n\n[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWait, no. Wait, row0 remains the same. Let me list all rows correctly:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,4,1,0,0,1,4,4,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,4,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,1,4,4,0,0,4,4,4]\n\nRow7: [0,0,1,4,1,0,0,1,4,4]\n\nRow8: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,4,1]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4]\n\nNow, check if this makes sense. The upper left block is used to replace all 5 blocks in the input. Each 5 block's rows are replaced with the corresponding rows from the upper left block.\n\nBut let's compare this to the training examples. For instance, in Example 0, the upper left 3 rows were used to replace the 5 blocks. Here, the same logic applies.\n\nYes, this seems to fit. So the final answer should be the transformed test input as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I'm looking at the training examples and need to see how the input is transformed into the output. \n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has numbers like 2, 4, 5. The output replaces 5 with 2, 4, 4 in some places. Let me check: in the input's lower part, the 5s become 2, 4, 4 in the output. For instance, the rows with 5s in the input's fifth row become [2,2,2], then [2,4,4], then [4,4,4]. Similarly, the 5s in the eighth row become 2, 4, etc. So maybe it's a rotation or a shift in the values? Like each group of the same number is being replaced by the previous group's numbers?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output, the 2s in rows 1-3 become the same in the output. But the 5s in the input (rows 4-6 and 7-9) become 2s and 4s in the output. Hmm. So maybe the 5s are being replaced by a sequence that starts with 2, then 4, similar to how the 2s and 4s were arranged in the upper part of the input. Like, the 5s in the lower part are mirroring the pattern of the upper numbers but shifted down.\n\nLooking at Example 1: input has 5,6,8. The output replaces the 5s with 6,8,6, etc. The first row's 5s become 6,6,6,6. Then the next row's 5s become 8,8,6,8. Then 6,8,8,8. So similar to the original 6,8,6,8 in the input's upper part. So it's like the values from the upper blocks are being copied to the lower blocks where the 5s were. \n\nWait, in Example 1, the input's upper part has 6,6,6,6 in the second row, then 8,8,6,8 in the third, then 6,8,8,8 in the fourth. Then in the output, the 5s in the first few rows become 6,6,6,6; then 8,8,6,8; then 6,8,8,8. So the pattern is that the 5s are replaced by the numbers from the upper blocks, but shifted. It's like the 5s in certain regions are taking the values from another region above or to the left, rotated or shifted in some way.\n\nPutting it together: maybe the transformation is that whenever there's a block of the same number (like 5s), they are replaced by the values from a previous block (like the 2s and 4s in Example 0, and 6s and 8s in Example 1), but rotated or shifted in their position. Like a cyclic shift of the non-zero blocks. For example, in Example 0, the 5s in the lower part are replaced by the 2 and 4 blocks from the upper part. Similarly, in Example 1, the 5s are replaced by the 6 and 8 blocks. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are a placeholder, and each occurrence of 5s in a certain position is replaced by a sequence of numbers that follow the same pattern as the upper blocks. So, in Example 0, the upper blocks are 2, then 4. The lower 5s become 2, then 4, then 4 again. Maybe each contiguous 5 block is replaced by the next number in the sequence of the upper numbers, cycling through them. But how does that sequence work?\n\nAnother angle: looking at the positions of the 5s. In Example 0's input, the 5s are in two main areas: the middle right and the lower middle. In the output, those 5s become 2s and 4s. The pattern of how they change seems to correspond to the upper blocks. For example, the first set of 5s (rows 4-6, columns 6-8) become 2, then 2,4, then 4. Which mirrors the upper blocks where 2s are followed by 4s. Similarly, the other 5s in rows 7-9 become 2, then 4 again. So maybe each group of 5s is replaced by the same sequence as the upper blocks, but shifted. So perhaps the transformation is that every 5 is replaced by the number from the same position in the upper part of the grid, shifted down by a certain number of rows.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 0. The output's fifth row (original input's fifth row with 5s) becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0]. In the input, the upper blocks (rows 1-3, columns 1-3) have 2s and 4s. So maybe the 5s in the lower part are replaced by the values from the upper blocks, but in a rotated manner. For example, the first occurrence of 5s in rows 4-6, columns 6-8 are replaced with the upper blocks (rows 1-3, columns 1-3) but rotated 180 degrees or something. Similarly, in Example 1, the 5s in the first row (columns 6-9) become 6,6,6,6. The upper part has rows with 6,6,6,6 (row 1) and 8,8,6,8 (row 2), so the output's first row's 5s become 6s, the next row's 5s become 8s, etc. So perhaps each vertical group of 5s is being replaced by a vertical slice from the upper part's blocks, rotated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced by the numbers from the same columns but in a previous row. For example, in Example 0, the 5s in column 6-8 of rows 4-6: in row 4, columns 6-8 are 5s. The output replaces them with 2,2,2. Looking at row 1, columns 1-3 (2,2,2). So it's taking the values from row 1 and placing them here. Then row 5 of the output has 2,4,4. Which corresponds to row 2 of the input (2,4,4). Row 6 of the output's 5s become 4,4,4, which is row 3 of the input. So the lower 5 blocks are being replaced by the upper blocks' rows in order. So rows 4-6's 5s are replaced by rows 1-3's data. Similarly, rows 7-9's 5s are replaced by rows 1-3 again? Let's see. The input rows 7-9 have 5s. The output rows 7-9 have 2,2,2 then 2,4,4 then 4,4,4. So that's again rows 1-3's data. So the 5s in the lower part are being replaced by the upper blocks in order. So each group of 5s is replaced by the corresponding upper block, but shifted down.\n\nIn Example 1, the first group of 5s is in the first row, columns 6-9. The output replaces them with 6,6,6,6. Looking at the input's row 1 (columns 1-4:6,6,6,6). So again, the 5s in row 0 (since the output's first row is 0-indexed maybe) get replaced by row 1's data. Then the next row's 5s (row 1 of input's columns 6-9) become 8,8,6,8, which is row 2's data. Then row 2's 5s become row 3's data. So it's taking the 5s and replacing them with the values from the same columns but the previous rows. Wait, but in the input of Example 1, the first row (output row 0) has 5s in columns 6-9, which become 6,6,6,6. The input row 1 (row index 1) has columns 1-4 as 6,6,6,6, which is where the output's 6s come from. So the 5s in a certain position are replaced by the values from the same columns but a specific number of rows above.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is that all 5s in the input are replaced by the values that are in the same column but a certain number of rows up. For example, in Example 0, the 5s in rows 4-6 (0-based would be rows 4-5-6 maybe) are replaced by the values from rows 1-3. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 5s start at row 4 (0-based index 4), columns 6-8. The output for those rows (4-6) becomes:\n\nRow4: 2,2,2 (from input row1: 2,2,2 in columns 1-3)\nRow5: 2,4,4 (input row2: 2,4,4)\nRow6:4,4,4 (input row3:4,4,4)\n\nSo for each row in the 5s block (rows 4-6), the replacement is taking the corresponding row from the upper block (rows1-3), but shifted. So row4 (5s) takes row1's values, row5 takes row2, row6 takes row3. Then, in the next block of 5s in rows7-9 (input rows7-9), the output rows7-9 are:\n\nRow7:2,2,2 (row1)\nRow8:2,4,4 (row2)\nRow9:4,4,4 (row3)\n\nSo again, the same pattern. So the 5s are replaced by the upper block's rows in order, regardless of where the 5s are. So whenever there's a group of 5s, the rows in that group are replaced by the first few rows of the upper block, in order.\n\nIn Example 1, the first group of 5s is in the first row (row0) columns6-9. The output replaces them with 6,6,6,6. Looking at the upper blocks: input row1 (row index1) columns1-4 are 6,6,6,6. So row0's 5s are replaced by row1's data. The next row (row1) has 5s in columns6-9, which become 8,8,6,8. Which matches input row2's columns1-4:8,8,6,8. Then row2's 5s become row3's data (6,8,8,8). So again, each row in the 5s block is replaced by the corresponding row from the upper block. \n\nSo the pattern is: wherever there's a contiguous block of 5s, each row within that block is replaced by the corresponding row from the first contiguous block of non-zero, non-5 numbers in the upper part of the input. For example, in Example0, the upper block is rows1-3 (2,2,2; 2,4,4; 4,4,4). Then, each 5-block's rows are replaced by those rows in order. If the 5-block is longer than the upper block, it cycles. But in Example0, the upper block has 3 rows, and each 5-block is 3 rows, so each is replaced by the upper rows in order. Similarly in Example1, the upper block (rows1-3) has three rows. The first 5-block in rows0-2 (assuming 0-based) is three rows. So replaced by rows1-3's data.\n\nSo applying this to the Test Input. Let's see. The test input has 4s, 1s, and 5s. The upper blocks would be the non-zero, non-5 regions in the upper part. Let's look:\n\nTest Input rows0-3 (first four rows):\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,4,0,...] \u2192 non-zero numbers 4,4,4.\nRow1: [0,1,4,4,0,...] \u2192 1,4,4.\nRow2: [0,1,4,1,0,...] \u21921,4,1.\nRow3: [0,1,1,1,0,...] \u21921,1,1.\n\nSo the upper block is rows0-3, but perhaps the first contiguous non-zero, non-5 blocks. Since rows0-3 have non-5 numbers (4s and 1s), that's the upper block. So each 5-block in the lower part would be replaced by rows0-3's data.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe first 5s are in row1, columns6-8 (values5,5,5). Then rows2,3,4 also have 5s in columns6-8. Then in row5, columns2-4:5,5,5. Rows6-8: columns7-9 (5,5,5). And row9 columns7-9:5,5,5.\n\nWait, let's list all the 5s blocks:\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow1: columns6-8:5,5,5\nRow2: same columns\nRow3: same\nRow4: same\nWait, looking at the input rows:\n\nRow1: [0,1,4,4,0,0,5,5,5,0] \u2192 columns6-8 (indices6,7,8) are 5s.\nRow2: columns6-8 also 5s.\nRow3: columns6-8 5s.\nRow4: columns6-8 5s. So rows1-4 have 5s in columns6-8. But rows5-9 have 5s in other regions.\n\nWait, perhaps each contiguous block of 5s is considered a separate group. For example, rows1-4 columns6-8: four rows. The upper block (rows0-3) has four rows. So each row in the 5-block would be replaced by the upper block's corresponding row. For example, row1's 5s (columns6-8) would be replaced by row0's 4,4,4 (columns1-3). Row2's 5s would be replaced by row1's 1,4,4. Row3's 5s \u2192 row2's 1,4,1. Row4's 5s \u2192 row3's 1,1,1. Then, in row5, the 5s are in columns2-4: rows5,6,7,8 (rows5-8) columns2-4. So that's four rows. The upper block has four rows (0-3), so replacing each row5-8's 5s with rows0-3's data. Then, rows6-9 have 5s in columns7-9. Let's check:\n\nRow5: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns2-4 are 5s.\nRow6: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5] \u2192 columns2-4:5,5,5 and columns7-9:5,5,5. So two separate 5-blocks here. Similarly, rows7 and 8 have columns2-4 and 7-9. Row9 has columns7-9.\n\nBut maybe the 5-blocks are grouped vertically. For example, the columns6-8 in rows1-4 are a vertical block. Then columns2-4 in rows5-8 are another vertical block, and columns7-9 in rows6-9 are another. But how does that fit the replacement pattern?\n\nAlternatively, each contiguous horizontal and vertical group of 5s is considered a block. For the test input:\n\nFirst block of 5s: rows1-4, columns6-8 (four rows). Upper block is rows0-3, so each of these rows' 5s would be replaced by rows0-3's data in columns1-3.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow1 (test input) has 5s in columns6-8. Replace with row0's columns1-3:4,4,4 \u2192 so 5s become 4,4,4.\n\nRow2's 5s \u2192 row1's columns1-3:1,4,4 \u2192 so 1,4,4.\n\nRow3's 5s \u2192 row2's columns1-3:1,4,1.\n\nRow4's 5s \u2192 row3's columns1-3:1,1,1.\n\nThen, the next 5-block is in row5, columns2-4. This is a single row? Or rows5-8's columns2-4.\n\nWait, row5: columns2-4 are 5,5,5. Then row6: columns2-4 are 5,5,5. Row7 and 8 also have columns2-4 as 5,5,5. So four rows (rows5-8), columns2-4. So this block would be replaced by upper block rows0-3's columns1-3. So:\n\nRow5's 5s \u2192 row0's columns1-3:4,4,4 \u2192 becomes 4,4,4.\n\nRow6's 5s \u2192 row1's 1,4,4.\n\nRow7's 5s \u2192 row2's 1,4,1.\n\nRow8's 5s \u2192 row3's 1,1,1.\n\nThen, the next block is rows6-9's columns7-9. Let's see:\n\nRow6: columns7-9 are 5,5,5.\n\nRow7: same.\n\nRow8: same.\n\nRow9: columns7-9:5,5,5. So four rows (rows6-9) in columns7-9. So replacing with upper block rows0-3's columns1-3.\n\nRow6's columns7-9 \u2192 row0's 4,4,4.\n\nRow7's \u2192 row1's 1,4,4.\n\nRow8's \u2192 row2's 1,4,1.\n\nRow9's \u2192 row3's 1,1,1.\n\nBut wait, in the test input's rows5-8, columns2-4 are 5s, and rows6-9's columns7-9 are 5s. So overlapping in row6-8. So when replacing, each vertical block is handled separately.\n\nSo applying this transformation:\n\nFor each 5 in the input, replace it with the value from the same column in the upper block. Wait, no, because in the training examples, the replacement seems to be taking the same row offset from the upper block. For example, in Example0's row4 (5s), replaced by row1's data (the upper block starts at row1). So for a 5 in row i, the replacement is from row (i - offset) in the upper block. But the upper block's start might vary.\n\nAlternatively, the upper block is the first contiguous block of non-zero, non-5 numbers. So in Example0's upper block is rows1-3 (values 2,4). The lower 5s are replaced by rows1-3 in sequence. So for a 5 in row i, it's replaced by the upper block's row (i - start_row_of_5_block) % upper_block_length.\n\nIn the Test Input, the upper block is rows0-3 (4s and 1s). So any 5-block's rows would be replaced by rows0-3 in order. For example:\n\nThe first 5-block is rows1-4 (four rows). So:\n\nRow1's 5s \u2192 row0 (0) of upper block:4,4,4.\n\nRow2's 5s \u2192 row1 of upper:1,4,4.\n\nRow3's 5s \u2192 row2 of upper:1,4,1.\n\nRow4's 5s \u2192 row3 of upper:1,1,1.\n\nThen, the next 5-block in rows5-8 (four rows) columns2-4:\n\nRow5 \u2192 row0 of upper:4,4,4.\n\nRow6 \u2192 row1:1,4,4.\n\nRow7 \u2192 row2:1,4,1.\n\nRow8 \u2192 row3:1,1,1.\n\nThe next 5-block in rows6-9 columns7-9:\n\nRow6 \u2192 row0:4,4,4.\n\nRow7 \u2192 row1:1,4,4.\n\nRow8 \u2192 row2:1,4,1.\n\nRow9 \u2192 row3:1,1,1.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRow1 (columns6-8) replaced with 4,4,4 \u2192 row1's output for columns6-8:4,4,4.\n\nRow2's 5s \u2192 1,4,4.\n\nRow3's \u21921,4,1.\n\nRow4's \u21921,1,1.\n\nRow5's columns2-4 \u21924,4,4.\n\nRow6's columns2-4 \u21921,4,4.\n\nRow6's columns7-9 \u21924,4,4.\n\nRow7's columns2-4 \u21921,4,1.\n\nRow7's columns7-9 \u21921,4,4.\n\nRow8's columns2-4 \u21921,1,1.\n\nRow8's columns7-9 \u21921,4,1.\n\nRow9's columns7-9 \u21921,1,1.\n\nBut wait, in the test input row6 has two sets of 5s: columns2-4 and 7-9. Each of these is replaced by the upper block's corresponding rows. So row6's 5s in columns2-4 (replaced by row0's 4,4,4) and 7-9 (replaced by row0's 4,4,4). So the entire row6 would have [0,0,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4].\n\nBut let's write out each row step by step.\n\nOriginal Test Input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,1,4,4,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,4,1,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,1,1,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5]\n\nRow7: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5]\n\nRow8: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5]\n\nNow, replacing 5s:\n\nRow1's columns6-8 (5,5,5) \u2192 replaced by row0's columns1-3:4,4,4. So row1 becomes [0,1,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,0].\n\nRow2's columns6-8: replaced by row1's columns1-3 (1,4,4). So [0,1,4,1,0,0,1,4,4,0].\n\nRow3's columns6-8: replaced by row2's columns1-3 (1,4,1). So [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,4,1,0].\n\nRow4's columns6-8: replaced by row3's columns1-3 (1,1,1). So [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0].\n\nThen row5's columns2-4 (5,5,5): replaced by row0's columns1-3 (4,4,4). So row5 becomes [0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow6's columns2-4 (5,5,5): replaced by row1's columns1-3 (1,4,4). So [0,0,1,4,4,0,0, ...]. Then columns7-9 (5,5,5) replaced by row0's columns1-3 (4,4,4). So row6 becomes [0,0,1,4,4,0,0,4,4,4].\n\nRow7's columns2-4 replaced by row2's columns1-3 (1,4,1) \u2192 [0,0,1,4,1,0,0, ...]. Columns7-9 replaced by row1's columns1-3 (1,4,4). So row7: [0,0,1,4,1,0,0,1,4,4].\n\nRow8's columns2-4 replaced by row3's columns1-3 (1,1,1) \u2192 [0,0,1,1,1,0,0, ...]. Columns7-9 replaced by row2's columns1-3 (1,4,1). So row8: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,4,1].\n\nRow9's columns7-9 (5,5,5) replaced by row3's columns1-3 (1,1,1). So row9 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1].\n\nPutting it all together, the output rows should be:\n\nRow0 remains the same.\n\nRow1: [0,1,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,4,1,0,0,1,4,4,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,4,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,1,4,4,0,0,4,4,4]\n\nRow7: [0,0,1,4,1,0,0,1,4,4]\n\nRow8: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,4,1]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. Comparing to the training examples' pattern where each 5s block is replaced by the upper block's rows in order. Yes, this seems to fit. For example, in row5, the 5s are replaced by row0's data. In row6's 5s, replaced by row1's, etc. And the overlapping blocks in row6 (two 5 groups) each take their respective replacements based on their row positions.",
