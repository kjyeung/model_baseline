        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. The training examples show inputs and outputs where some parts of the input arrays are replaced with 1s or another number. Let me look closer.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The output has three 1s towards the end of some rows. Like in row 6, the input ends with [0,0,0,5], and the output changes those to [1,1,1,5]. Similarly in rows 7 and 8. But other rows don't have this change. So maybe whenever there are three consecutive 0s followed by a 5, they get replaced by 1s? Wait, in example 0's input row 6, the original is [0,0,0,5], which becomes [1,1,1,5]. Then in example 1, the changed parts are three 0s turned to 1s. For example, in input row 6 of example 1, the input has [0,0,0] in positions 3-5, which become [1,1,1]. Similarly, example 2's input rows 6 and 7 have three 0s that become 1s.\n\nWait, but in example 0, the three 0s are at the end, followed by 5. But in example 1, the three 0s are in the middle. Hmm. Let me check each example's changes.\n\nExample 0's changed rows (output rows 6,7,8):\n\nInput row 6: ends with 0,0,0,5 \u2192 output 1,1,1,5.\n\nInput row 7: ends with 0,0,0,5 \u2192 becomes 1,1,1,5.\n\nInput row 8: ends with 0,0,0,5 \u2192 1,1,1,5.\n\nSo maybe whenever there are three consecutive zeros followed by the non-zero number (like 5 here), they get replaced by 1s. But in example 1, the non-zero number is 3. Let's see example 1's changes. The changed rows are 6,7,8. For example, input row 6 of example 1 has [0,0,0] in positions 3-5, and the output changes those to 1s. But what's after them? Let's check the input row 6 of example 1: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]. The output changes positions 3-5 (0,0,0) to 1,1,1. The next element is 0, which is zero. Wait, that's different. Hmm. Then maybe the pattern isn't about the following number. Maybe it's just three consecutive zeros that are replaced by 1s, but only in certain positions?\n\nWait, let's look at the positions where the 1s appear. In example 0, the 1s start at index 16 (17th element) in row 6. Let's check the input row 6: the original array is [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,5]. The output changes the last three 0s to 1s. So positions 16-18: 0,0,0 \u2192 1,1,1. Then the last element is 5. So maybe three consecutive zeros that are followed by a non-zero, but in example 1's row 6, the input is [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]. The output is [0,3,0,1,1,1,3,3,...]. So here, the three consecutive zeros at positions 3-5 (indices 3,4,5) are replaced by 1s, followed by a 0. So maybe the rule is: whenever there are three consecutive zeros (regardless of what comes after), replace them with 1s. But why only certain rows in the examples?\n\nWait, looking at all the training examples, the only rows that change are those where three consecutive zeros are present. For example, in example 0's output, only rows 6,7,8 have 1s, and those are the rows where the input had three consecutive zeros. Let's check:\n\nExample 0 input rows:\n\nRow 6: ...0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,5 \u2192 looking at the input array for row 6:\n\nOriginal input for row 6 (example 0) is:\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,5]\n\nWait, positions 16-18 (0-based) are 0,0,0. So three consecutive zeros, replaced by 1s. Similarly, row7 input: [0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5]. So positions 16-18 are 0,0,0 \u2192 replaced by 1s. Row8 input: ... positions 16-18: 0,0,0 \u2192 1s.\n\nIn example1's input, the rows that changed have three consecutive zeros. For example, row6 input has three 0s (positions 3-5), row7 has three 0s starting at position 3 (0-based?), and row8 has three 0s starting at position3. So the pattern seems to be: wherever three consecutive zeros appear in the input array, replace them with three 1s. But wait, in example0's row6, the three zeros are followed by a 5. In example1's row6, the three zeros are followed by another 0. So it doesn't matter what comes after. So the rule is: in any row, if there's a sequence of three 0s, replace them with three 1s. But why in the examples, not all such sequences are replaced?\n\nWait, in example0's input row9: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,5]. The input has three zeros at positions 4-6 (0,0,0?), but in the output, it's [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,5]. Wait, the output doesn't change those three zeros. So why not?\n\nWait the output for example0's row9 is same as input. So maybe the rule isn't replacing all three consecutive zeros. Let me check the exact positions where the replacement happens in the examples.\n\nIn example0's output, the changes occur in the last four elements. For example:\n\nRow6 input ends with [0,0,0,5], output [1,1,1,5]. So the three zeros are replaced, but the 5 remains.\n\nRow7 input ends with [0,0,0,5] \u2192 becomes [1,1,1,5].\n\nRow8 input ends with [0,0,0,5] \u2192 same.\n\nBut in example1's changes:\n\nRow6 input has [0,0,0] starting at position3 (elements 4-6 in 1-based?), which are replaced by 1s.\n\nRow7 input has [0,0,0] at positions3-5 \u2192 1s.\n\nRow8 input has [0,0,0] at positions3-5 \u2192 1s.\n\nSo maybe the replacement happens only when three 0s are present starting at position 16 (since in example0, the replacement is at the end, positions 16-18 (0-based)), which is index 16,17,18. Let's check:\n\nIn example0's input row6: the array length is 20. The three zeros are at indices 16,17,18 (elements 17-19 in 1-based). So replacing the last three zeros before the last element (which is 5). Wait, the last element is 5. So the three zeros are followed by 5. But in example1's changes, the three zeros are followed by 0. So maybe the position matters. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, the three 0s are at the 17th,18th,19th positions (if 1-based), but the array length is 20. So indices 16,17,18 (0-based) of 20 elements. Wait, 20 elements: indices 0-19. So the three zeros are in positions 16,17,18 (0-based), followed by 5 at index19.\n\nIn example1's row6, the three zeros are at positions3-5 (indices3,4,5). So the rule isn't based on their position in the array. Hmm. So maybe the pattern is that whenever three consecutive zeros occur in the input array, replace them with three 1s. But why in example0's row9, the input has three zeros (positions4-6) that are not replaced. Let me check example0's row9 input and output:\n\nInput row9 (example0) is [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,5]. The output is the same. But there's a sequence of three zeros at positions4-6 (0-based: 4,5,6: 0,0,0). Why weren't those replaced?\n\nHmm, this contradicts the initial hypothesis. So the replacement isn't happening for all three consecutive zeros. So maybe there's another condition. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example0's output rows that have changes:\n\nRow6,7,8. Let me check the input arrays for those rows:\n\nRow6 input: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,5]. So the three zeros are at positions16-18 (0-based). The output changes those to 1s. The next element is 5.\n\nRow7 input: [0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5]. The three zeros are at positions16-18. Output changes to 1s, followed by 5.\n\nRow8 input: [5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5]. The three zeros are at positions16-18. Output changes to 1s.\n\nSo in all these cases, the three zeros are at positions16-18 (the 17th, 18th, 19th elements in 1-based), followed by a 5 at position19. But in example1, the changed rows (6,7,8) have three zeros in positions3-5. For example, row6 of example1 input is [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]. The three zeros are at positions3-5 (indices3,4,5). The output replaces those with 1s. So in example1, the three zeros are in the middle of the array, not near the end. So why were they replaced there but not other instances?\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement occurs only once per row, perhaps the first occurrence of three consecutive zeros. Let's check:\n\nIn example0's row6, there are three zeros at positions16-18. Are there any other sequences of three zeros? Let's see. The input for row6 is [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,5]. So the three zeros at 16-18. Are there other three zeros? At positions9-10: 0,0, but that's only two. So only one sequence of three zeros. So in that case, it's replaced. But in example0's row9, the input has three zeros at positions4-6. Why weren't they replaced? Let me check the output for row9 in example0: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,5]. The three zeros at positions4-6 are still zeros. So why weren't they replaced?\n\nThis suggests that the replacement isn't simply any three consecutive zeros. There must be another condition. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the replacement occurs in the last three positions before the end. Wait, in example0, the three zeros are at positions16-18 (0-based), which are elements 17-19 (1-based) in a 20-element array. So positions 17-19 are the 17th, 18th, 19th elements. The 20th element is position19. So in example0, the three zeros are followed by a 5 (position19). Wait, in example0's row6, the last element is 5. The three zeros are at positions16-18, followed by 5. So maybe the rule is: replace three consecutive zeros that are followed by a non-zero (the same non-zero as the rest of the array) with 1s. Let's check.\n\nIn example0, all the replaced three zeros are followed by 5 (the non-zero value). In example1, the replaced three zeros (row6) are followed by 3? Let's check example1's row6 input: after the three zeros at positions3-5 (0-based), the next element is 3 (position6). So the three zeros are followed by 3. So they are replaced by 1s. In example2's row6, the three zeros are replaced by 1s. The next element after them is 7 (since the input row6 of example2 is [0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,7], and the output changes the three zeros at positions3-5 (0-based) to 1s. Wait, the input here is:\n\nFor example2 row6 input:\n\n[0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,7]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,7,1,1,1,0,7,7]\n\nWait, the input has three zeros at positions 14-16 (0-based) (assuming the input array is 20 elements). Let me check the exact input for example2 row6:\n\nThe input is [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7]. So the three zeros start at position14 (0-based) which are elements 15-17 (1-based). The output replaces those three zeros (positions14-16) with 1s. The next element after is 0 (position17). So the three zeros are followed by a zero, but they are still replaced. So the previous idea about being followed by a non-zero is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let me try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input. For the test case, the input arrays are with 4s and 0s. According to the pattern, we need to find three consecutive 0s in some rows and replace them with 1s. Let's check the test input rows for sequences of three 0s.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0]. Here, positions9-11 (0-based) are 0,0,0. So three consecutive zeros. Would these be replaced by 1s?\n\nRow1: [0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0]. Positions10-12: 0,0,0. So three zeros.\n\nRow2: [4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0]. No three consecutive zeros.\n\nRow3: [4,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0]. Positions4-6: 0,0,4 \u2192 not three. Position6-8: 0,0,0. Positions6-8: 0,0,0 (indices6,7,8). So three zeros.\n\nRow4: [4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,4]. No three zeros.\n\nRow5: [4,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,0]. Positions1-3: 4,0,0. No. Positions5-7:0,0,4. No. So no three zeros.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,4]. The first three elements are 0,0,0. So three zeros.\n\nRow7: [4,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]. Positions4-6:0,0,0. Three zeros.\n\nRow8: [0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0]. Positions4-6:0,0,0.\n\nRow9: [4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,4]. Positions1-3:0,0,0.\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,4,4]. First three elements:0,0,0.\n\nRow11: [0,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0]. Positions9-11:0,0,0.\n\nRow12: [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4]. No three zeros in a row.\n\nRow13: [4,0,4,4,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0]. Positions10-12:0,0,0.\n\nRow14: [0,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4]. Positions5-7:0,0,4. No.\n\nRow15: [4,0,0,4,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,0]. Positions1-3:0,0,4. No. Positions9-11:0,0,4. No.\n\nRow16: [4,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. Positions14-16:0,0,0.\n\nRow17: [4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,4]. Positions1-4:0,0,0,0. So three zeros at positions1-3.\n\nRow18: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Positions0-2:0,0,0. Also positions3-5:0,0,4. So the first three are zeros.\n\nRow19: [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4]. Positions2-4:0,0,0. Also positions5-7:0,0,4. So three zeros starting at position2.\n\nSo according to the training examples, whenever there are three consecutive zeros, they are replaced with 1s. But why in example0's row9, there are three zeros not replaced. Wait, maybe the replacement happens only once per row, the first occurrence. Let's check example0's row9. The input has three zeros at positions4-6 (0-based) and possibly others. Let me count the input for example0 row9:\n\nInput row9 (example0): [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,5]. So the three zeros are at positions4-6. Are there any other three zeros? Position0-1:0,0,5 (only two zeros). So only one occurrence of three zeros. But in the output, they are not replaced. So that contradicts the idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement occurs only when the three zeros are followed by the same number as the rest of the array. For example, in example0, the non-zero is 5. So three zeros followed by 5 are replaced. But in example0's row9, the three zeros are followed by 5. So why weren't they replaced?\n\nWait, the input row9 for example0 is:\n\n[0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,5]\n\nThe three zeros are at positions4-6 (0-based: indices4,5,6). So elements 4,5,6 are 0,0,0. The next element is 5 (position7). So according to the previous idea, this should be replaced. But in the output, it's not. So that can't be the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement happens only in the last three elements (positions17-19, 0-based). Let's check example0's changed rows:\n\nRow6's three zeros are at positions16-18 (elements 16,17,18), followed by 5 at position19.\n\nRow7's three zeros are also at positions16-18, followed by 5 at 19.\n\nRow8's three zeros at positions16-18, followed by 5.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: in each row, if the 17th, 18th, 19th elements (0-based 16,17,18) are zeros, replace them with 1s, regardless of what's after. Let's check example1's changed rows.\n\nExample1 row6: the input is [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]. The output replaces positions3-5 (0-based) with 1s, which is not the end. So this contradicts the idea.\n\nHmm. So what's the common factor in all the changed rows across examples?\n\nLooking at example0's rows 6,7,8: the three zeros replaced are all at the same positions (indices16-18). But in example1, the replaced three zeros are in different positions. So maybe it's not based on their position. Then I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: compare the input and output arrays for each example to see exactly where the changes are.\n\nExample0, row6 input: ...0,0,0,5 \u2192 output ...1,1,1,5.\n\nExample0, row7 input: ...0,0,0,5 \u2192 output ...1,1,1,5.\n\nExample0, row8 input: ...0,0,0,5 \u2192 output ...1,1,1,5.\n\nExample1, row6 input: ...0,0,0,0... \u2192 three zeros replaced by 1s (positions3-5, followed by 0).\n\nExample1, row7 input: ...0,0,0,0... \u2192 three zeros replaced by 1s (positions3-5).\n\nExample1, row8 input: ...0,0,0,3... \u2192 three zeros replaced by 1s (positions3-5, followed by 3).\n\nExample2, row6 input: ...0,0,0,0... \u2192 three zeros replaced by 1s (positions14-16, followed by 0).\n\nExample2, row7 input: ...0,0,0,0... \u2192 three zeros replaced by 1s (positions14-16).\n\nExample2, row8 input: ...0,0,0,0... \u2192 three zeros replaced by 1s (positions3-5).\n\nWait, in example2's row17 and 18:\n\nInput row17: [7,7,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]. Output becomes [7,7,7,1,1,1,7,0,...].\n\nSo three zeros at positions3-5 (indices3,4,5) replaced by 1s.\n\nRow18 input: [7,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,7,7,0,7]. Output changes to [7,0,0,1,1,1,7,7,...].\n\nThree zeros at positions3-5 (indices3,4,5) replaced by 1s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: replace the first occurrence of three consecutive zeros in the array with 1s. Because in example0's row6, the first occurrence is at the end. In example1's row6, the first occurrence is at positions3-5. In example2's row6, the first occurrence is at positions3-5 (input row6 of example2 is [0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,7], so the first three zeros are at the start (positions0-2) but in the output, they are replaced by 1s. Wait no, the output for example2 row6 is [0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,7,1,1,1,0,7,7]. So the three zeros that are replaced are at positions14-16. So that's not the first occurrence. The first occurrence is positions0-2: three zeros, but they are not replaced. So that contradicts the 'first occurrence' hypothesis.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's look for another pattern. Perhaps the replacement is done when three consecutive zeros appear after a certain position. For example, in example0, the replaced zeros are in the last three elements before the last element. Maybe the rule is: if the last three elements before the last element are zeros, replace them with 1s.\n\nIn example0's row6 input: the last four elements are [0,0,0,5]. So positions16-18 (three zeros) followed by 5. Replaced with 1s.\n\nIn example1's row6 input: the three zeros are in the middle, not near the end. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace any three consecutive zeros that are followed by a non-zero. Let's check:\n\nExample0 row6: three zeros followed by 5 \u2192 replaced.\n\nExample0 row7: three zeros followed by5 \u2192 replaced.\n\nExample0 row8: three zeros followed by5 \u2192 replaced.\n\nExample1 row6: three zeros followed by0 \u2192 but replaced. So that's not it.\n\nExample2 row6: three zeros followed by0 \u2192 replaced.\n\nSo this can't be the rule.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the number of changes per example. In each training example, the output is the same as the input except for three consecutive 1s in certain rows. The number of changed rows varies. For example0, three rows are changed (6,7,8). Example1, three rows (6,7,8). Example2, three rows (6,7,8, and also row17, 18,19). Wait, example2's output has changes in rows6,7,8,17,18,19. Let me check:\n\nNo, example2's output has changes in rows6,7,8,17,18,19. For example:\n\nRow6: positions14-16 \u2192 1,1,1.\n\nRow7: positions14-16 \u2192 1,1,1.\n\nRow8: positions3-5 \u2192 1,1,1.\n\nRow17: positions3-5 \u21921,1,1.\n\nRow18: positions3-5 \u21921,1,1.\n\nRow19: ?\n\nWait, in example2's output:\n\nRow17: [7,7,7,1,1,1,7,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow18: [7,0,0,1,1,1,7,7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,7,7,0,7].\n\nSo the three zeros are replaced in rows17,18, and also row6,7,8.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to find a pattern based on the fact that in each example, the 1s are replacing three consecutive zeros, and this happens in certain rows. Perhaps the rows that have three consecutive zeros followed by a non-zero (like the same number as the majority in the array). For example, in example0, the non-zero is 5. So if three zeros are followed by 5, replace with 1s. In example1, non-zero is 3. If three zeros are followed by 3, replace with 1s. In example2, non-zero is7, so three zeros followed by7 are replaced with1s.\n\nBut checking example0's row9: three zeros followed by5 (same as the majority) but not replaced. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done in the rows where there are exactly three consecutive zeros, and they are not part of a longer sequence. For example, if there are four consecutive zeros, then the first three are replaced, or not.\n\nExample2's row6 input has four consecutive zeros starting at position14. The output replaces the first three with 1s, leaving the fourth as zero.\n\nExample0's row7 input has three zeros followed by5. So replaced.\n\nExample0's row9 input has three zeros followed by5. Not replaced.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done in the last three elements of the array, but only if they are zeros. For example0, the last three elements of the array are 0,0,5. No. The three zeros are in positions16-18, followed by 5. So that's not the last three elements.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me look at the test input and see if I can find any pattern there. The test input has several rows with three consecutive zeros. For example, row0 has three zeros in positions9-11. If the pattern is to replace any three consecutive zeros with 1s, then those would become 1s. But according to the training examples, perhaps only certain instances are replaced. For example, in the training examples, the replacement seems to happen in the rows where the three zeros are followed by the same number as the other non-zero elements. But that doesn't hold for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for the first occurrence of three consecutive zeros in each row. Let's check example0's row6: three zeros are the first occurrence. Example1's row6: three zeros are the first occurrence. Example2's row6: three zeros are the first occurrence. But example0's row9 has three zeros at positions4-6, which would be the first occurrence. But it's not replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for the last occurrence of three consecutive zeros in each row. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row6: three zeros at the end (positions16-18) \u2192 replaced.\n\nExample1's row6: three zeros in the middle \u2192 replaced. But it's the first occurrence.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the replacement occurs when three zeros are followed by a non-zero (could be any number). For example, in example0's row6, the three zeros are followed by5. In example1's row6, the three zeros are followed by3. In example2's row6, the three zeros are followed by0. So this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for three consecutive zeros that are surrounded by the same non-zero number. For example, in example0's row6: the three zeros are between5 and5. So surrounded by5's. But no, they are between5 and5. But in example1's row6, the three zeros are between0 and3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the three zeros are replaced by 1s when they are followed by a non-zero, but regardless of what comes after. But example2's row6 shows that even if followed by zero, they are replaced.\n\nI'm really not seeing the pattern. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the replaced 1s are the same in each example. For example, in example0, the three zeros are replaced by1s, example1 also 1s. So the replacement is to 1s regardless of the original non-zero number. So the number 1 is used as a replacement, not related to the original non-zero numbers (5,3,7).\n\nSo the rule could be: in any row, if there's a sequence of three consecutive zeros, replace them with three 1s.\n\nBut then why in example0's row9, the three zeros are not replaced.\n\nWait, in example0's row9 input:\n\n[0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,5]\n\nThe three zeros are at positions4-6 (0-based indices4,5,6). The output is the same as the input, so they are not replaced. Why? There must be a condition that excludes them.\n\nMaybe the three zeros must be followed by a non-zero, and in example0's row9, the three zeros are followed by5 (non-zero). But they weren't replaced. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three zeros are replaced only if they are not at the beginning or end of the array. But in example1's row6, the three zeros are in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three zeros are replaced only if they appear after a certain number of elements. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement happens only in certain rows based on their index. For example, in the training examples, the changed rows are rows6,7,8 in example0, rows6,7,8 in example1, and rows6,7,8 and others in example2. But that's probably a coincidence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done in every third row. But example0's changed rows are 6,7,8. Not every third.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think about the test input. The test input's rows have multiple three-zero sequences. For example, row0 has three zeros. If the pattern is to replace any three consecutive zeros with 1s, then those would be replaced. Let's assume that's the case. So in the test input, any three consecutive zeros in a row are replaced by 1s. Let's see what that would look like.\n\nFor example, row0 of test input: [0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0]. The three zeros are at positions9-11 (indices9,10,11). Replace those with 1s. So the output row0 would have 1,1,1 in those positions. Similarly for other rows.\n\nBut according to the training examples, this doesn't always happen. For example, in example0's row9, three zeros are not replaced. So there's a condition. Maybe the three zeros are replaced only if they are followed by the same number that appears elsewhere in the array. But in the test input, the non-zero is4, so any three zeros followed by4 would be replaced. Let's check the test input rows:\n\nRow0: three zeros at9-11, followed by4. So replaced.\n\nRow1: three zeros at10-12, followed by0. Not sure.\n\nRow3: three zeros at6-8, followed by0.\n\nRow6: three zeros at0-2, followed by4.\n\nRow7: three zeros at4-6, followed by4.\n\nRow8: three zeros at4-6, followed by4.\n\nRow9: three zeros at1-3, followed by4.\n\nRow10: three zeros at0-2, followed by4.\n\nRow11: three zeros at9-11, followed by4.\n\nRow13: three zeros at10-12, followed by0.\n\nRow16: three zeros at14-16, followed by0.\n\nRow17: three zeros at1-3, followed by4.\n\nRow18: three zeros at0-2, followed by0.\n\nRow19: three zeros at2-4, followed by0.\n\nSo, if the rule is to replace three zeros followed by the same non-zero number (4 in this case), then rows0,6,7,8,9,10,11,17 would have their three zeros replaced. Other rows with three zeros followed by0 or other numbers wouldn't be replaced. But in example0, the three zeros followed by5 were replaced, so this rule would fit. In example1, the three zeros followed by3 were replaced. In example2, three zeros followed by7 were replaced.\n\nBut in example2's row6, the three zeros are followed by0 and still replaced. So this contradicts the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done regardless of what follows, as long as there are three consecutive zeros. But why some cases in training examples are not replaced.\n\nWait, perhaps the training examples have the same input and output except for certain rows. Looking at example0's output, most rows are the same as input, except rows6,7,8. Similarly for example1 and example2. So maybe the replacement is only done if the row index is a multiple of 3? Row6,7,8 (indices6,7,8). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement happens in every row where the row number is divisible by 3. But example0's changed rows are 6,7,8 (which are indices6,7,8 in the list). Hmm, 6 is divisible by 3, 7 and 8 are not. So that's not it.\n\nI'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, maybe I should proceed with the hypothesis that any three consecutive zeros in the input are replaced by three 1s. Even though there are exceptions in the training examples, but perhaps I missed something. For example, in example0's row9, maybe there's another condition. Let me check example0's row9 input again:\n\nInput row9: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,5]. So three zeros at positions4-6. Are there any non-zero numbers surrounding them? The element before is4: 0, then positions4-6 are 0,0,0, followed by5 at position7. So the three zeros are between0 (position3) and5 (position7). So maybe the rule is to replace three zeros that are between two non-zero numbers. For example, in example0's row6: three zeros are between5 (position15) and5 (position19). In example1's row6: three zeros between0 (position2) and0 (position6). Not sure. But in example0's row9, the three zeros are between0 (position3) and5 (position7). So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the three zeros must be preceded by a non-zero. In example0's row6: the three zeros are preceded by5. In example0's row7: three zeros are preceded by5. In example0's row8: three zeros are preceded by5. In example0's row9: three zeros are preceded by0, so not replaced. That could be the case. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row6: three zeros after5. Replaced.\n\nExample0's row7: three zeros after5. Replaced.\n\nExample0's row8: three zeros after5. Replaced.\n\nExample0's row9: three zeros after0. Not replaced.\n\nExample1's row6: three zeros after0 (element at position2 is0). So preceded by0. But they are replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nExample1's row6: three zeros at positions3-5. The element before is0 (position2). So according to this hypothesis, they shouldn't be replaced, but they are.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three zeros must be preceded by a non-zero and followed by a non-zero. For example, in example0's row6: preceded by5, followed by5 \u2192 replaced. In example0's row7: preceded by5, followed by5 \u2192 replaced. In example0's row9: preceded by0, followed by5 \u2192 not replaced. In example1's row6: preceded by0, followed by0 \u2192 not replaced, but they are replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm out of ideas. Given the time I've spent, I think the best bet is to assume that any three consecutive zeros in the input are replaced by three 1s. Even though there are exceptions in the training examples, but perhaps those are mistakes or I'm missing a subtlety. For the test input, I'll replace all occurrences of three consecutive zeros with 1s.\n\nNow, let's process each row in the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nThree zeros at indices9-11: replace with 1s.\n\nOutput row0: [0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,1,1,1,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nThree zeros at indices10-12: replace with 1s.\n\nOutput row1: [0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,1,1,1,0,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow2: [4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0] \u2192 no three zeros.\n\nRow3: [4,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nThree zeros at indices6-8 (0,0,0), and another three at 7-9 (0,0,0). So first occurrence at6-8. Replace with 1s.\n\nOutput row3: [4,4,0,4,0,0,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nWait, indices6-8 are 0,0,0. Replace with 1s. So row3 becomes:\n\n[4,4,0,4,0,0,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nRow4: [4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,4] \u2192 no three zeros.\n\nRow5: [4,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,0] \u2192 no three zeros.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,4]\n\nThree zeros at0-2, then four zeros at3-6. Replace first three with 1s.\n\nOutput row6: [1,1,1,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,4]\n\nRow7: [4,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThree zeros at4-6. Replace with 1s.\n\nOutput row7: [4,0,4,4,1,1,1,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nThree zeros at4-6. Replace with1s.\n\nOutput row8: [0,4,4,4,1,1,1,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,4]\n\nThree zeros at1-3.

Replace with1s.\n\nOutput row13: [4,0,4,4,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,1,1,1,0,4,4,4,0,0]\n\nRow14: [0,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 no three zeros.\n\nRow15: [4,0,0,4,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,0] \u2192 no three zeros.\n\nRow16: [4,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nThree zeros at14-16. Replace with1s.\n\nOutput row16: [4,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,1,1,1,0,4,4]\n\nRow17: [4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,4]\n\nThree zeros at1-3. Replace with1s.\n\nOutput row17: [4,1,1,1,0,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,4]\n\nRow18: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThree zeros at0-2. Replace with1s. Then the next three zeros (indices3-5) are0,0,4 \u2192 not three. Then other zeros.\n\nOutput row18: [1,1,1,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow19: [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4]\n\nThree zeros at2-4. Replace with1s.\n\nOutput row19: [4,4,1,1,1,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4]\n\nSo each row where three consecutive zeros are found is replaced with 1s. But this may not match the training examples where some three zeros were not replaced. However, given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with this approach.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to find the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the training examples to figure out what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 0: the input and output are almost the same, except for some positions where 0s are changed to 1s. Let me compare the input and output for each line. \n\nTake the first input line in Example 0. The output is identical. The same for the second line. But starting from line 6 in the input, the output has [..., 0, 0, 0, 5] becoming [1, 1, 1, 5]. Wait, in line 6 of the input, the last three elements are 0,0,0,5. In the output, those three 0s become 1s. Similarly, line 7's input ends with 0,0,0,5, which becomes 1,1,1,5. Line 8's input ends with 0,0,0,5 again, turned into 1s. But line 9 in the input ends with ...5,0,5,5, which in the output remains the same. Hmm, so maybe there's a condition where a trio of 0s followed by a 5 gets changed to 1s. But looking at the position, maybe it's the last three elements before the final element? Or perhaps it's the 17th, 18th, 19th elements (indexing from 0) being replaced if they are 0s. Let's check the positions.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input line 6: the elements from index 16 to 18 are 0,0,0 (since the array is 20 elements). The output changes them to 1,1,1. Then the next element (index 19) remains 5. Similarly, line 7's input has elements 16-18 as 0,0,0, which become 1s. Line 8's input at positions 16-18 are 0,0,0 again, changed to 1s. So the pattern seems to be: in each row, if the 16th, 17th, and 18th elements (third to last, second to last, and last but one) are all 0s, they are replaced by 1s. Wait, but the array length is 20, so indices 0-19. The positions being modified are 16,17,18 (elements 17th, 18th, 19th in 1-based), which are the 17th, 18th, 19th elements. Wait, maybe it's the last three elements except the very last one? Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's line 6 input: the original elements from index 16 to 18 (0-based) are 0,0,0. Output is 1,1,1. Then the last element (index 19) is 5, which stays. So the transformation is replacing three consecutive 0s starting at index 16 (positions 17,18,19 in 1-based) with 1s. But wait, in the output, the last element is still 5. So the three 0s are in positions 16,17,18 (0-based), which are the 17th, 18th, 19th elements. Wait, no: if the array has 20 elements, index 0 is first, index 19 is last. So positions 16,17,18 are the 17th, 18th, 19th elements. So maybe whenever there are three consecutive 0s in positions 16,17,18 (third, second, and first positions from the end, but not the very end?), or perhaps in any three consecutive 0s in the array? But looking at other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, line 6 input is [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0]. The output changes indices 3,4,5 (0-based) from 0,0,0 to 1,1,1. So the output becomes [0,3,0,1,1,1,3,3,0,3,...]. Wait, but the original elements at positions 3,4,5 are 0,0,0. So that's three consecutive 0s. So maybe whenever there's a trio of consecutive 0s in any position, they are replaced by 1s? But in Example 0's line 6, the 0s are at the end. Hmm, but in Example 0, the input line 6's output changes three 0s at positions 16,17,18 (assuming 0-based) to 1s. But in Example 1, line 6's input has 0s at positions 3,4,5. So maybe it's not fixed positions. Alternatively, maybe the first occurrence of three consecutive 0s in each row is replaced by 1s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's line 6 input: the input array is [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,5]. The three 0s are at positions 16,17,18 (0-based) and they become 1s. Are there other triple 0s in this row? Let's see: the start has 5s, then at index 9 and 10: 0,0. Then index 12: 0. Then at 16,17,18: 0,0,0. So the first triple 0s are at the end. So in this case, the first occurrence is replaced.\n\nIn Example 1, line 6 input: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]. The first three 0s start at index 3 (0-based), which are positions 3,4,5. So they are replaced by 1s. The next three 0s start at index 9, but it's two 0s. Then at index 12, there's 0,0,0. But in the output, those are replaced as well? Wait, looking at the output for Example 1, line 6: [0,3,0,1,1,1,3,3,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]. So only the first occurrence of three 0s is replaced. Then the next 0s at positions 9,10 are two 0s, which aren't changed. The 0s at 13,14,15 are three 0s but they remain as 0s. So why aren't they replaced? That suggests that only the first occurrence of three consecutive 0s in each row is replaced by 1s.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, line 6's input has only one set of three consecutive 0s. In line 7 of Example 0's input: [0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5]. The input has three 0s at the start (positions 0,1,2) and three at positions 6,7,8, and three at positions 16,17,18. The output for this line is [0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,1,1,1,5]. So the three 0s at positions 16,17,18 are replaced. So the first occurrence of three consecutive 0s would be at the start, but they are not replaced. Wait, but in the output, the first three 0s are still 0s, but the ones at positions 16-18 are replaced. That contradicts the hypothesis that the first occurrence is replaced. So maybe the pattern is that the last three elements before the last one are replaced? Wait, in Example 0, line 6's output, the last three elements (indices 17,18,19) are 0,0,0,5. Wait, the input's last elements are 0,0,0,5. The output changes the three 0s to 1s, keeping the 5. So indices 16,17,18 (the 17th, 18th, 19th elements) are replaced. Wait, the array length is 20. So indices 0-19. So in line 6 of Example 0, the input's elements at indices 16,17,18 are 0,0,0 (values before the last element, which is at index 19). The output changes those three to 1s. Similarly, in line 7 of Example 0's input, indices 16,17,18 are 0,0,0, which become 1s. In line 8's input, indices 16,17,18 are 0,0,0, which become 1s. So the pattern seems to be: replace the three elements at indices 16,17,18 (third, second, and first from the end) with 1s if they are 0s. But in line 9 of Example 0's input, those positions are 5,0,5, so no change. So the rule is: in each row, the elements at positions 16,17,18 (0-based) are changed to 1s if they are 0s. Let's verify with other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, line 6's output: the input's elements at 16,17,18 would be 3,0,3 (since the input is [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]). Wait, positions 16 is index 16 (0-based), which is the 17th element. Let me count: in the input line for Example 1, line 6 input: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]. So indices 16,17,18 are 3,0,3. But in the output, these are changed to 1,1,1? Wait no. Wait, the output for Example 1's line 6 is [0,3,0,1,1,1,3,3,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]. So the 1s are at positions 3,4,5. That contradicts the previous idea. Hmm, this complicates things. Because in that case, the positions being changed are not the same as in Example 0. So maybe the rule isn't fixed positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first occurrence of three consecutive 0s in each row is replaced by 1s, regardless of their position. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0's line 6 input: the three consecutive 0s at positions 16,17,18 are the first occurrence. So they are replaced. In line 7's input: there are three 0s at the start (positions 0-2), then another three at positions 6-8, and then three at 16-18. The first occurrence is positions 0-2, but they are not replaced. Wait, but in the output, only the 16-18 positions are replaced. So that can't be the first occurrence. So maybe it's the last occurrence of three consecutive 0s in the row?\n\nIn line 7's input: the three 0s at positions 16-18 are the last occurrence. So they are replaced. Similarly, in line 6's input, that's the only occurrence. In line 7, the first three 0s are at the start, but in output they remain 0s. The replaced ones are the last three 0s. So maybe it's the last occurrence of three consecutive 0s in the row that's replaced.\n\nBut how about Example 1's line 6 input: the input is [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]. The first occurrence of three 0s is at positions 3-5 (indices 3,4,5). The output replaces those with 1s. So in that case, the first occurrence is replaced. But in Example 0, the first occurrence (like line 7's input) is not replaced. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the three consecutive 0s that are followed by a non-zero value. Let's check. For Example 0 line 6 input: the three 0s at 16-18 are followed by 5. So they are replaced. In Example 1 line 6 input: the three 0s at 3-5 are followed by 3 (index 6), so replaced. In Example 0 line 7 input: three 0s at 16-18 are followed by 5, replaced. The three 0s at 0-2 are followed by 5, but not replaced. So perhaps there's a specific condition where the three 0s must be followed by a certain number. Wait, but in Example 0, the replaced 0s are followed by 5. In Example 1, replaced 0s are followed by 3. In Example 2, looking at line 6's output: the input is [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,0,0,7,0,7]. The output changes the 0s at positions 14-16 (indices 14,15,16) to 1s. Because in the input, they are 0,0,0, followed by 7. So maybe the rule is: three consecutive 0s followed by the same number as the rest of the array. Wait, but in the training examples, all arrays have elements either 0 or another number (like 5,3,7). So perhaps the rule is: in each row, find the three consecutive 0s that are followed by the non-zero number of the array (like 5 in Example 0, 3 in Example 1, 7 in Example 2) and replace them with 1s. But how to determine which non-zero number to look for. Alternatively, perhaps the three consecutive 0s must be followed by the same non-zero number that's prevalent in the array. But in Example 0, the array has mostly 5s and 0s, so the non-zero is 5. So when three 0s are followed by 5, they become 1s. In Example 1, the non-zero is 3, and three 0s followed by 3 are replaced. In Example 2, three 0s followed by 7 are replaced. \n\nLooking at Example 2's line 6 input: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,0,0,7,0,7]. The three 0s are at indices 14,15,16 (values 0,0,0) followed by 7 (index 17). So they are replaced by 1s. So the pattern seems to be: in each row, if there are three consecutive 0s followed by the dominant non-zero number (which is the same across the array), replace those three 0s with 1s. The dominant non-zero number is the one that's not zero and appears most in the array. But how to find where to replace. Alternatively, the three 0s must be followed by a non-zero (whatever it is, but in the examples, each array has only one non-zero number besides 0). So in the test case, the arrays have 4s and 0s. So the non-zero number is 4. So wherever three 0s are followed by a 4, they become 1s.\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the non-zero number is fixed for each array. All arrays in the input of each example have only one non-zero number besides 0. For example, in Example 0, all non-zero elements are 5. So when three 0s are followed by 5, replace with 1s. Similarly for Example 1 (3s) and Example 2 (7s). So the rule is: in each row, if the three consecutive 0s are followed by the non-zero number of the array (which is the same throughout the array), then those three 0s are replaced by 1s. The position where this occurs varies per row.\n\nSo, the steps for each row would be:\n\n1. Identify the non-zero number in the array (all non-zero elements are the same, except possibly some 0s).\n\n2. Find the occurrence of three consecutive 0s followed by this non-zero number.\n\n3. Replace those three 0s with 1s.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's line 6 input: the three 0s are followed by 5 (the non-zero number). So they are replaced. In Example 1's line 6 input: three 0s followed by 3 (non-zero) are replaced. In Example 2's line 6 input: three 0s followed by 7 are replaced.\n\nBut in some other lines, like Example 0's line 9 input: the array has 5s and 0s, but the three 0s in positions (like 5,0,5) are not followed by a 5, so they aren't replaced. \n\nSo applying this to the test input. The test input arrays have non-zero number 4. So in each row, wherever three consecutive 0s are followed by a 4, replace them with 1s.\n\nNow, let's look at the test input.\n\nTest input lines:\n\nFirst line: [0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nLooking for three consecutive 0s followed by 4. Let's scan the array:\n\nIndices (0-based):\n\nLooking for 0,0,0 followed by 4. The array:\n\n0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0\n\nLooking at positions:\n\nAt index 9,10,11: 0,0,0. Next element (index 12) is 4. So this is three 0s followed by 4. So replace indices 9,10,11 (0,0,0) with 1,1,1. The rest of the array remains the same.\n\nSo the output for the first line would be:\n\n[0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,1,1,1,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nNext line: [0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nLooking for three 0s followed by 4. The array:\n\n0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0\n\nLooking for three 0s followed by 4. Let's see:\n\nAt indices 10,11,12: 0,0,0. Next is index 13 (value 0). So not followed by 4. Then indices 11,12,13: 0,0,0, followed by 4 (index 14). So three 0s at 11,12,13 followed by 4. Wait, but indices 11,12,13 are 0,0,0 (values). The next element is index 14:4. So yes. So replace those three 0s with 1s.\n\nSo the output line would be:\n\n[0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nWait, but let me check the indices correctly. The array is:\n\nIndices 0-19:\n\n0:0,1:0,2:4,3:4,4:0,5:0,6:4,7:0,8:4,9:4,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:4,15:4,16:4,17:4,18:4,19:0.\n\nSo looking for three 0s followed by 4. Let's see:\n\nAt indices 10,11,12: 0,0,0. Next is index 13:0. So not followed by 4.\n\nIndices 11,12,13: 0,0,0. Next is index 14:4. So yes. So replace indices 11,12,13 (values 0,0,0) with 1s. So the array becomes:\n\n[0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nThird line of test input: [4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0]\n\nLooking for three 0s followed by 4. Let's see:\n\nIndices where 0s are:\n\nAt index 3,4:0,0. Then index 5 is 4. Not enough. Index 6:0. Then index 7:4. So no three 0s. Index 8:0. Index 9:4. No. Index 10:0. Then index 11:4. So no three consecutive 0s followed by 4. So no replacement. So the output is same as input.\n\nWait, but let me check again:\n\nThe array is:\n\n4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0.\n\nLooking for three 0s in a row followed by 4. The array has:\n\nAt indices 3,4:0,0. Then 5 is 4. Not three.\n\nAt index 6:0, followed by 4 (index7). Then index8:0, index9:4. Index10:0, index11:4. So no three consecutive 0s. So no replacement.\n\nFourth line: [4,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nLooking for three 0s followed by 4.\n\nThe array is:\n\n4,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\nIndices 7,8,9:0,0,0. Next is 0 (index10). Not 4.\n\nIndices 8,9,10:0,0,0. Next is 0 (index11). Not 4.\n\nIndices 9,10,11:0,0,0. Next is 0 (index12). Not 4.\n\nIndices 10,11,12:0,0,0. Next is 0 (index13). Not 4.\n\nIndices 11,12,13:0,0,4. Next is 4 (index14:4). Wait, indices 11,12,13:0,0,0? No. Let's check the array:\n\nLine 4: [4,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0].\n\nWait, after index 12 (value 0), index13 is 4. So the three 0s are at indices 10,11,12 (0,0,0) followed by 4 (index13). So replace indices 10-12 with 1s.\n\nSo the output line would be:\n\n[4,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,1,1,4,4,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nFifth line: [4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,4]\n\nLooking for three 0s followed by 4. Let's see:\n\nThe array is: [4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,4].\n\nLooking for three consecutive 0s. The array has:\n\nAt index 1,2:0,0. Then index3 is4. Not three.\n\nAt index5:0, followed by4. Then index13:0, followed by4. So no three 0s. So no replacement.\n\nSixth line: [4,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,0]\n\nLooking for three 0s followed by 4. The array:\n\n4,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,0.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\nAt indices 2,3:0,0. Then index4 is4. No.\n\nAt indices 5,6:0,0. Then index7 is4. No.\n\nAt indices 13,14:0,0. Then index15 is4. No. So no three 0s followed by 4. So no replacement.\n\nSeventh line: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,4]\n\nLooking for three 0s followed by4. Let's see:\n\nIndices 0,1,2:0,0,0. Next is4 (index3). So replace 0-2 with1,1,1.\n\nSo output line becomes [1,1,1,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,4].\n\nEighth line: [4,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for three 0s followed by4.

So next possible: indices 9:0, followed by4 (index10). No three 0s. indices12-14:0,4,0. No. indices14-16:0,0,0. Next is0. No. So no replacement.\n\nNineteenth line: [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4]\n\nLooking for three 0s followed by4.\n\nAt indices 2,3,4:0,0,0. Next is0 (index5). No. indices3,4,5:0,0,0. Next is0. indices4,5,6:0,0,0. Next is4 (index7). So three 0s at 4-6 followed by4. Replace with1s.\n\nResult: [4,4,0,0,1,1,1,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4].\n\nPutting all these together, each line in the test input is modified by replacing the first occurrence of three consecutive 0s followed by a 4 with 1s. But wait, in some cases there are multiple three 0s followed by4. But according to the training examples, it's the first occurrence? Or the only occurrence? For example, in the first line of the test input, the three 0s are at positions9-11 followed by4. In the seventh line, the three 0s are at the start. So we replace the first occurrence of three 0s followed by4.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in the training examples, only the first occurrence is replaced. Looking back at Example 1's line6, the first three 0s are replaced. In Example 0's line7, the last three 0s are replaced. So perhaps it's the last occurrence of three 0s followed by the non-zero number.\n\nWait, no. Example 0's line7 input has multiple three 0s sequences, but the one that is replaced is the last three 0s in the array. But in that input, the three 0s at the start are followed by5. So why weren't they replaced? Because in Example0 line7's input, the three 0s at positions0-2 are followed by5 (the non-zero number). So according to the rule, they should be replaced. But in the output, they are not. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three 0s must be the last three elements before the end of the array. For example, in Example0's line6 input, the three 0s are at indices16-18, which are the 17th, 18th, 19th elements (if length is 20). The next element after that is index19, which is5. But in that case, the three 0s are followed by5. So they are replaced. But in line7 of Example0's input, the three 0s at positions16-18 are followed by5, and replaced. The three 0s at positions0-2 are followed by5 but are not replaced. So why the discrepancy?\n\nThis suggests that the rule is not simply three 0s followed by the non-zero number, but perhaps the three 0s are in specific positions. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the three consecutive 0s that are closest to the end of the array. So in Example0's line7 input, the three 0s near the end are replaced, while the ones at the beginning are not. So the rule is to replace the rightmost occurrence of three consecutive 0s followed by the non-zero number.\n\nBut how to determine which occurrence. For example, in Example1's line6 input, the three 0s are at positions3-5 (earlier in the array) and are replaced. So that's the first occurrence from the left. So perhaps the rule is to replace the first occurrence of three consecutive 0s followed by the non-zero number, regardless of position.\n\nBut in Example0's line7 input, the three 0s at positions0-2 are followed by5 but are not replaced. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three consecutive 0s must be followed by the non-zero number and appear exactly once in the array. But that doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three 0s must be preceded by a non-zero number. For example, in Example0's line6 input, the three 0s at16-18 are preceded by5 (index15), and followed by5. So they are between two 5s. But in Example1's line6 input, the three 0s are preceded by0 and followed by3. So that theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three 0s are part of a larger group of 0s, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three 0s are part of the last four elements of the array. For example, in Example0's line6, the three 0s are at positions16-18, followed by5 (index19). So in the last four elements. In Example1's line6, the three 0s are at positions3-5, which are not near the end. So that's not consistent.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's look for another approach.\n\nLooking at all training examples, the output arrays have exactly one set of three consecutive 1s. So each output line has exactly one trio of 1s. The input line may have multiple possible places where three 0s could be replaced, but only one is replaced in the output.\n\nSo the rule is to replace the first occurrence of three consecutive 0s followed by the non-zero number (the one present in the array) with 1s.\n\nBut in Example0's line7 input: [0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5]. The non-zero is5. The three 0s at positions0-2 are followed by5. The three 0s at positions6-8 are followed by5. The three 0s at positions16-18 are followed by5. So why are only the last trio replaced? Because in the output, it's the last trio that's replaced. So maybe it's the last occurrence of three 0s followed by5 that's replaced.\n\nIn Example0's line7 output: the 0s at16-18 are replaced. So the last occurrence. Similarly, in Example0's line6, there's only one occurrence. So the rule may be to replace the last occurrence of three consecutive 0s followed by the non-zero number in the array.\n\nSo the approach is: in each row, find the last occurrence of three consecutive 0s followed by the non-zero number of the array, and replace those three 0s with 1s.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample0's line7 input: the last occurrence of three 0s followed by5 is at positions16-18. So replaced.\n\nExample1's line6 input: the last occurrence of three 0s followed by3 is at positions3-5. But there are other occurrences later. For example, in Example1's line6 input: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]. The three 0s at positions3-5 are followed by0, which is not3. Wait, no. The three 0s at3-5 are followed by0 (index6:3). No, index6 is3. So after three 0s at3-5, the next element is3. So followed by3. So this is a valid occurrence. Then later in the array, at indices12-14:0,0,0, followed by3 (index15:0. No, index15 is0. So no. So in this case, the last occurrence of three 0s followed by3 is positions3-5. So they are replaced.\n\nIn Example2's line6 input: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,0,0,7,0,7]. The three 0s at14-16 (indices14,15,16) are followed by7 (index17). So this is the last occurrence of three 0s followed by7, replaced by1s.\n\nSo the rule is: in each row, replace the last occurrence of three consecutive 0s followed by the non-zero number (which is the same throughout the array) with 1s.\n\nThus, for the test input lines, which have non-zero number4, we need to find in each row the last occurrence of three consecutive 0s followed by4, and replace those 0s with1s.\n\nLet me recheck the test input lines with this rule.\n\nFirst test input line:\n\n[0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nLooking for three 0s followed by4, last occurrence.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\nAt indices9-11:0,0,0 followed by4 (index12). This is the last occurrence. So replace9-11 with1s.\n\nOutput line: [0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,1,1,1,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0].\n\nSecond line: [0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nLooking for three 0s followed by4, last occurrence.\n\nThe three 0s at indices11-13:0,0,0, followed by4 (index14). So replace11-13 with1s.\n\nOutput: [0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,0].\n\nThird line: [4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0]\n\nLooking for three 0s followed by4.

The three 0s at indices10-12:0,0,0 followed by0 (index13:4). So followed by4. So indices10-12:0,0,0 followed by4 (index13:4).

No. Then indices15-17:0,0,0 followed by4 (index18). So replace15-17 with1s.\n\nOutput: [4,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,0,1,1,1,4,4].\n\nSeventeenth line: [4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,4]\n\nLast occurrence of three 0s followed by4: indices14-16:0,0,0 followed by4 (index17:4).

The three 0s at indices0-2:0,0,0 followed by0. No. indices2-4:0,0,0 followed by4 (index5:4). So replace2-4 with1s. But is this the last occurrence? Are there other three 0s followed by4 later?\n\nLooking further, indices14-16:0,0,0 followed by0. indices17-19:0,0,0. So no. So the last occurrence of three 0s followed by4 is indices2-4. Replace them with1s.\n\nOutput: [0,0,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nNineteenth line: [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4]\n\nLooking for last occurrence of three 0s followed by4.

Replace4-6 with1s.\n\nOutput: [4,4,0,0,1,1,1,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4].\n\nThis seems to align with the training examples where the last occurrence of three 0s followed by the non-zero number is replaced with 1s. Now, applying this to the test input, each line's output should have exactly one trio of 1s replacing the last occurrence of three 0s followed by4.",
