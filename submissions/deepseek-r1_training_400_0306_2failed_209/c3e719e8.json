        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these training examples where the input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, and the output is a larger grid, like 9x9. Let me look at the examples closely.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three rows: [3,8,7], [9,3,8], [7,9,3]. The output is a 9x9 grid. Looking at the output, the first three rows have the original numbers followed by zeros. Then the next three rows have zeros, then the original numbers again shifted to the middle, and more zeros. The last three rows have zeros and then the original numbers at the end. Wait, maybe it's divided into blocks. Like each original row is placed in different positions in the output grid.\n\nWait, let me count. The output for Example 0 has 9 rows. Each original row is replicated in different sections. The first three rows of the output start with the original row and then zeros. Then rows 4-6 have the original rows shifted to the middle. Rows 7-9 have them shifted to the end. So maybe the output is a 3x3 grid of blocks, each block being a 3x3 matrix. The original matrix is placed in each diagonal block, and the off-diagonal blocks are zero matrices? But in Example 0, the output has three original matrices arranged along the diagonal, each followed by zeros. Wait, but in the output, the first three rows have the first row of the input in the first three positions, then zeros. Then the next three rows have the input matrix shifted to the fourth position. And the last three rows have it shifted to the seventh position. Oh, maybe it's tiling the original matrix in a 3x3 block structure, but each block is a 3x3 matrix. So the original 3x3 matrix is placed along the diagonal of the 3x3 blocks, and the other blocks are zeros. So the output is a 9x9 matrix divided into 3x3 blocks where each diagonal block is the original matrix, and others are zero.\n\nBut Example 1 seems different. Let's look at Example 1. The input is three rows: [8,6,8], [3,3,8], [8,8,8]. The output starts with the first three rows having the original row, then zeros, then the original row again. Then the next three rows are zeros except for the last three elements being the original rows. Then the last three rows have the original rows duplicated in the first, fourth, and seventh positions. Wait, maybe in this case, the blocks are not diagonal. For example, in the first three rows, the first and third blocks (positions 0-2, 6-8) are filled with the original rows. The middle block (3-5) is zeros. Then rows 4-6 have only the third block filled. And the last three rows have the first, fourth, and seventh blocks filled. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe each row of the output is constructed by placing copies of the original rows in specific positions. For example, in Example 0, each original row is placed in three different positions in the output rows, separated by zeros. The first three output rows have the original row in the first three positions, zeros in the middle three, and zeros in the last three. Then the next three output rows have zeros in the first, original row in the middle three, zeros in the last. The last three have zeros in the first and middle, original row in the last three. So it's like each original row is placed in three different columns of the output rows, each time in a different third of the row. But how does that vary between examples?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, each original row is in three different positions. The first three rows have the original rows in positions 0-2, then zeros. Then rows 4-6 have them in positions 3-5. Then rows 7-9 in 6-8. So for each original row, there's a new row in the output where that row is shifted by 3 positions each time, and the rest are zeros. But how does that apply to the other examples?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output. The first three rows have the original row in positions 0-2, then zeros, then the original row again in positions 6-8. So the same row appears twice in the same output row. Then the next three rows (rows 4-6) have zeros in the first two blocks and the original row in the third. The last three rows (7-9) have the original row in all three blocks. Wait, that's more complex. So perhaps the pattern isn't the same across examples. Maybe the way the original matrix is tiled depends on some property of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by arranging three copies of the input matrix in some pattern. For example, in Example 0, the output is a 3x3 grid of the input matrix, where each position in the 3x3 grid is either the input matrix or a zero matrix. So the diagonal blocks are the input, others are zero. But Example 1's output seems to have more non-zero blocks. Like the first three rows have the input in the first and third blocks, and the middle block is zero. Then the middle three rows have only the third block. The last three rows have the input in all three blocks. So the arrangement varies.\n\nHmm. Let's look for another approach. Let's see the output in terms of how the input rows are arranged. For example, in Example 0, each input row is replicated three times in the output, each time shifted by three positions. So for the first input row [3,8,7], the output has rows where this is placed in positions 0-2, then 3-5 (but in Example 0, the second block is all zeros, except for the middle block which has the original rows). Wait, maybe the output is a 3x3 block matrix where each block is either the original matrix or a zero matrix, arranged in a certain way. The first example's output has three blocks along the diagonal, each being the input matrix. The second example's output has blocks in different positions. Let's count the blocks in Example 1:\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nFirst three rows: [8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8] \u2192 this is the original first row in positions 0-2 and 6-8. So the first and third blocks are filled. Then next three rows have the original rows in the third block. Then the last three rows have the original rows in all three blocks. So the blocks are filled in a way that depends on the example. Maybe there's a pattern based on the numbers in the input matrix. But that seems too vague.\n\nAnother angle: the output grids are 9x9, which is 3x3 times 3x3. So perhaps each output row is a combination of the original rows, but arranged in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 0, each output row is the original row followed by zeros, then another copy of the row shifted, etc. But this doesn't hold for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by concatenating the input matrix in different positions. For instance, the first three rows of the output are the input matrix followed by two zero matrices (each zero matrix being 3x3). The next three rows are a zero matrix, the input, another zero. The last three are zero, zero, input. So that's a 3x3 block matrix with the input on the diagonal. But Example 1's output doesn't fit that. In Example 1, the first three rows have the input in the first and third blocks. So maybe the arrangement isn't diagonal here.\n\nWait, let's check the dimensions. The input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So each input element is somehow mapped into a 3x3 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each row of the input is transformed into a row in the output by replicating it in different sections. For example, in Example 0, each input row becomes a row in the output by placing the original elements in the first three positions, then zeros. Then, another row where the elements are shifted to the middle three positions. Then another shifted to the end. So each input row generates three output rows, each shifted by three positions. Then this is done for each row of the input, leading to 3x3=9 rows.\n\nWait, that could make sense. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, input has three rows. Each row is placed in three different positions in the output. For example, the first input row [3,8,7] is in the first output row as [3,8,7, 0s], the fourth output row has [0s, 3,8,7, 0s], and the seventh output row has [0s, 3,8,7]. But in Example 0's output, the fourth row is [0,0,0,3,8,7,0,0,0], which fits. So each input row is placed in three different output rows, each shifted by 3 positions. Then, each of the three input rows creates three output rows. So 3 input rows \u00d7 3 shifts each \u2192 9 output rows. That seems to fit Example 0.\n\nBut then Example 1's output doesn't follow this pattern. Let's check. Example 1's input is three rows. Let's see the first input row is [8,6,8]. In the output, the first row is [8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8]. So the same row appears in the first three positions and the last three. Then the fourth row is all zeros except the last three, which are the input's first row again. Wait, this doesn't match the previous pattern. So maybe the shifts aren't fixed. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, rows 0-2 have the original rows in positions 0-2 and 6-8. Then rows 3-5 have zeros except positions 6-8. Rows 6-8 have the original rows in positions 0-2, 3-5, and 6-8. So for each original row, there are three output rows where the row is placed in different combinations of the three blocks. Like first block and third, then third, then all three. Hmm, but how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of circular shift or replication based on the elements in the input matrix. For example, in Example 0, the input matrix has numbers like 3,8,7. The sum of the first row is 18. But I don't see how that would relate to the output.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the positions where the original numbers are placed. For example, in Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [3,8,7, 0,0,0, 0,0,0]\nRow 1: [9,3,8, 0,0,0, 0,0,0]\nRow 2: [7,9,3, 0,0,0, 0,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,0, 3,8,7, 0,0,0]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,9,3,8, 0,0,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,7,9,3, 0,0,0]\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,7]\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,9,3,8]\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,9,3]\n\nThis looks like three diagonal blocks of the original matrix. So output is a block diagonal matrix with three copies of the input. But then Example 1's output isn't like that. So why the difference?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nOriginal matrix rows:\n[8,6,8]\n[3,3,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nThe output rows are:\n\nRow 0: [8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8]\nRow 1: [3,3,8,0,0,0,3,3,8]\nRow 2: [8,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,8]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8]\nRow 6: [8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8]\nRow 7: [3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8]\nRow 8: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nHere, in rows 0-2, the original row is in the first and third blocks (positions 0-2 and 6-8). Then rows 3-5 have the original rows only in the third block. Rows 6-8 have the original row in all three blocks. So this is a different arrangement. What's different about the input matrices between the examples?\n\nExample 0's input has distinct rows, while Example 1's third row is all 8s. Not sure if that's relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by replicating the input matrix in a way that depends on the values in certain positions. For example, the first element of the first row determines how many times the row is replicated in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by shifting the original rows cyclically. For example, in Example 0, each row is shifted by 0, 3, 6 positions. But in Example 1, the shifts are different. For instance, row 0 has the original in positions 0-2 and 6-8, which are shifts of 0 and 6. Then row 3 has shift 6 again. Row 6 has shifts 0, 3, 6. Maybe the shifts are determined by some value in the input.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nInput:\n[6,9,9]\n[4,6,8]\n[9,9,8]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,6,9,9,6,9,9]\nRow 1: [0,0,0,4,6,8,4,6,8]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,9,9,8,9,9,8]\nRows 3-5 are all zeros.\nRows 6-8: [6,9,9,6,9,9,0,0,0], [4,6,8,4,6,8,0,0,0], [9,9,8,9,9,8,0,0,0]\n\nSo here, rows 0-2 have the original rows in positions 3-5 and 6-8. Then rows 6-8 have them in positions 0-2 and 3-5. The middle rows are zeros. So again, the arrangement varies.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's look for a pattern that connects the input to how their outputs are structured. Maybe the key is to look at the positions where the original elements are placed and see if there's a relation to the elements themselves.\n\nFor instance, in Example 0, the output is a diagonal block matrix. Maybe the sum or some other feature of the input determines this. The input sum for Example 0 rows: 3+8+7=18, 9+3+8=20, 7+9+3=19. Not sure.\n\nIn Example 1, the input rows sum to 22, 14, and 24. But I don't see a connection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the positions where the original rows are placed are determined by the values in the first element of each row. For example, in Example 0, the first element of the first row is 3. Maybe that's why the rows are placed in the first, fourth, seventh positions (since 3 modulo 3 is 0, but not sure). But this is unclear.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. For each block (i,j), it's either the original matrix or a zero matrix. The pattern of which blocks are filled varies between examples. So in Example 0, the blocks (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) are filled (diagonal). In Example 1, perhaps blocks (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are filled. Example 2 has blocks (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1) filled. So how is this pattern determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is determined by the diagonal of the input matrix. For example, in Example 0, the diagonal elements are 3,3,3. So maybe if the diagonal elements are all the same, the output is diagonal blocks. But in Example 1, the diagonal is 8,3,8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of unique elements in the input determines the pattern. But in Example 0, there are more unique elements than in Example 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a Kronecker product. For example, if the input matrix is A, the output could be a Kronecker product with another matrix. For instance, the identity matrix would give a diagonal block structure, like Example 0. But other matrices would give different patterns. For Example 1, maybe the Kronecker product is with a matrix like [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,1,1]]. But how to determine which matrix to use based on the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the input determines how many times the row is repeated in certain positions. For example, the first element of the row determines the position. But this seems vague.\n\nLet me try to find another approach. For each example, the output rows are formed by concatenating copies of the input rows with zeros in between. For example, in Example 0, each output row is the input row followed by zeros. Then the next set is zeros followed by the input row, then zeros. Then zeros followed by the input row. So three times, each shifted by three positions. But in Example 1, the first three rows have the input row in positions 0-2 and 6-8. So two copies. Then the next three rows have it in 6-8. Then the last three have it in 0-2, 3-5, and 6-8. So three copies. So the number of copies varies per example.\n\nPerhaps the number of copies and positions are determined by some property of the input rows. For example, if a row starts with an even number, it is placed in certain positions. Or if a row contains a certain number, like 8, it is replicated more times.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nFirst row: [8,6,8] \u2192 starts with 8 (even).\nSecond row: [3,3,8] \u2192 starts with 3 (odd).\nThird row: [8,8,8] \u2192 starts with 8 (even).\n\nThe output for these rows has the first and third rows (starting with even) appearing in more positions. For instance, the first row appears in first and third blocks in the first three output rows, then in all three blocks in the last three. The third row also appears multiple times. The second row, starting with 3, only appears in the third block in the middle rows and all blocks in the last. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the row modulo 3 determines the position. For Example 0's first row sum 18 \u2192 0 mod 3. So placed in position 0. Second row sum 20 \u2192 2 mod 3. Third row sum 19 \u2192 1 mod 3. But in the output, all rows are placed in positions 0, then 3 (which is 1 in terms of block index), then 6 (block index 2). So the block index is incrementing, regardless of the sum. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to look for a pattern in how the input rows are arranged in the output.\n\nFor each output row in the examples, the input row appears in certain blocks (each block is 3 elements). The key is to find what determines which blocks are filled.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nEach input row is placed in one block per output row. The first three output rows have the input row in block 0 (positions 0-2). Next three in block 1 (3-5). Next three in block 2 (6-8). So each input row is placed in all three block positions across three output rows. So for each input row, there are three output rows: one for each block position. Hence, 3 input rows \u00d7 3 block positions = 9 output rows.\n\nBut in Example 1, the first three output rows have the input row in blocks 0 and 2. So two blocks filled. Then next three in block 2. Last three in blocks 0,1,2. So it's not the same as Example 0. So what's different between the inputs that causes this change?\n\nAnother thought: maybe the arrangement depends on the elements in the input matrix in a way that each element determines whether the corresponding block is filled. For example, the first element of the input row determines how many blocks are filled. But this is not clear.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input:\n\nInput rows:\n[6,9,9]\n[4,6,8]\n[9,9,8]\n\nOutput rows 0-2: the original rows are in blocks 1 and 2 (positions 3-5 and 6-8). Rows 6-8 have the rows in blocks 0 and 1. So each input row is placed in two blocks per output row.\n\nSo there's a pattern where each input row is placed in certain blocks in the output rows. The blocks vary between examples, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is being used as a kernel for a convolution operation, but this seems unlikely given the examples.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell is a 3x3 block. The input matrix is placed in certain cells of this grid. For example, in Example 0, the input is placed in the diagonal cells. In Example 1, it's placed in the top-left, top-right, middle-right, bottom-left, bottom-middle, and bottom-right cells. In Example 2, it's placed in the top-middle, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-middle cells. But how to determine which cells to fill based on the input?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the position of the input row in the output depends on the row's elements. For example, if a row has a certain number (like 8 in Example 1), it is placed in more positions.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a row appears in the output is determined by the count of a specific element in the row. For instance, in Example 1's third row [8,8,8], which has three 8s, it appears in all three blocks in the last three output rows. Maybe the number of a certain element (like the first element) dictates how many times the row is replicated.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the first element of each input row in Example 0:\n\n3,9,7. These are all different. In the output, each row is placed in three distinct blocks. In Example 1, the first elements are 8,3,8. The rows with first element 8 (first and third) are placed in more blocks. The row with first element 3 is placed in fewer. So perhaps the number of times a row is replicated depends on the first element's value. If it's even, replicate more times. But 3 is odd, and in Example 1, the second row is replicated in the third block and then all blocks in the last rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of times a row is placed is determined by the number of unique elements in the row. Example 0's rows have 3 unique elements each (maybe?), but Example 1's third row has all 8s. But the replication count in Example 1 is higher for the third row. But this is speculative.\n\nWait, let's look at the output structure for each example:\n\nExample 0:\n- Diagonal blocks.\n\nExample 1:\n- First three rows: blocks 0 and 2 filled.\n- Middle three: block 2 filled.\n- Last three: all blocks filled.\n\nExample 2:\n- First three: blocks 1 and 2 filled.\n- Middle three: all zeros.\n- Last three: blocks 0 and 1 filled.\n\nThis seems arbitrary, but maybe there's a connection to the input matrix's structure. For example, in Example 1, the third row is all 8s. In the output, this row is replicated in all three blocks in the last three output rows. So maybe if a row has all elements the same, it's replicated in all blocks. But in Example 0, no row has all elements the same, so they are only in one block per output row.\n\nIn Example 2, the third row is [9,9,8], which has two 9s. In the output, it's placed in two blocks per row.\n\nSo perhaps the replication depends on the number of duplicate elements in the row. For example:\n\n- If a row has all elements the same (like Example 1's third row), replicate in all three blocks.\n- If a row has two duplicates, replicate in two blocks.\n- If all elements are unique, replicate in one block.\n\nBut checking this:\n\nExample 0's input rows:\n\nRow 0: 3,8,7 \u2192 all unique \u2192 placed in one block per output row. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 1's rows:\n\nRow 0: 8,6,8 \u2192 two 8s \u2192 replicated in two blocks (blocks 0 and 2).\nRow 1: 3,3,8 \u2192 two 3s \u2192 replicated in two blocks? But in Example 1's output, the second row is placed in blocks 0 and 2 in the first output row, then block 2 in the middle, then all three in the last. So maybe this theory doesn't hold.\n\nExample 2's rows:\n\nRow 0:6,9,9 \u2192 two 9s \u2192 placed in two blocks (blocks 1 and 2).\nRow 1:4,6,8 \u2192 all unique \u2192 placed in two blocks (blocks 1 and 2 in output rows 0-2). Wait, this contradicts the theory.\n\nHmm, this doesn't seem to hold.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the position is determined by the first element. For example, the first element modulo 3 determines the starting block. So in Example 0:\n\nRow 0 starts with 3 \u2192 3 mod 3 = 0 \u2192 block 0.\nRow 1 starts with 9 \u2192 9 mod 3 = 0 \u2192 block 0.\nRow 2 starts with7 \u21927 mod3=1 \u2192 block 1.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, all rows are placed in blocks 0,1,2 respectively. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first element determines how many times the row is replicated. For example, 3 in Example 0's first row \u2192 3 times. But 3 mod 3 is 0, and the row is replicated three times. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the pattern is that each input row is replicated three times in the output, each time shifted by three positions, but the number of shifts depends on the row's elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the input row determines a position in the output row. For example, the first element of the input row is the first element of the first block, the second element the first of the second block, and the third the first of the third block. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each row is the input row repeated three times, but separated by zeros. For example, in Example 0, the first output row is [3,8,7, 0,0,0, 0,0,0], which is the input row followed by two zero blocks. Then the fourth row is [0,0,0, 3,8,7, 0,0,0], which is the input row shifted to the second block. The seventh row is shifted to the third block. So for each input row, there are three output rows, each with the row in a different block. This fits Example 0.\n\nBut how does this apply to Example 1? In Example 1's output, the first row is [8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8], which is the input row in the first and third blocks. So the same row is placed in two blocks. Then, the fourth row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8], which is the row in the third block. The seventh row is [8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8], which is the row in all three blocks. So this is different from Example 0. So why the difference?\n\nAh, maybe the number of times a row appears in the output depends on the elements in the row. For example, if a row has duplicates, it's replicated more times. But in Example 1's first row, [8,6,8] has duplicates, so it appears in two blocks in the first output row and three in the seventh. While in Example 0, rows are unique and appear once per output row.\n\nBut how does that explain Example 2?\n\nExample 2's first input row is [6,9,9]. The first output row for this is [0,0,0,6,9,9,6,9,9], which has the row in blocks 1 and 2. Then in row 6, it's [6,9,9,6,9,9,0,0,0], blocks 0 and 1. So two blocks per row. But this row has two 9s. So perhaps the number of duplicates determines the number of blocks per row.\n\nThis seems possible. So the pattern could be:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- The number of duplicate elements in the row determines how many blocks in the output row are filled with that input row.\n\nBut how exactly?\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nEach row has all unique elements. So each output row fills one block.\n\nExample 1:\n\nRow 0: [8,6,8] \u2192 two 8s. So the output rows for this row fill two blocks in the first three rows and three blocks in the last row.\n\nRow 1: [3,3,8] \u2192 two 3s. So output rows fill two blocks (first and third in row 1), then one block (third in row 4), then three blocks in row 7.\n\nRow 2: [8,8,8] \u2192 all duplicates. So output rows fill all three blocks in the last three rows.\n\nExample 2:\n\nRow 0: [6,9,9] \u2192 two 9s. So output rows fill two blocks (blocks 1 and 2 in row 0, and blocks 0 and 1 in row 6).\n\nRow 1: [4,6,8] \u2192 all unique. So output rows fill one block (blocks 1 and 2 in row 1 and row 6).\n\nWait, this doesn't align. In Example 2's row 1 (all unique), the output rows have it in two blocks. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the output as a combination of the input rows arranged in different ways. The number of copies of each row in the output depends on certain criteria.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[1, 1, 7]\n[7, 4, 1]\n[5, 1, 7]\n\nLet's try to apply the pattern from the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the output was three copies of the input matrix arranged along the diagonal. Each row appears in three different positions. But the other examples don't follow this.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has the first row appearing in the first and third blocks, then the third block, then all three. So the number of times a row is replicated increases.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to proceed. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: look at the output as a 3x3 matrix where each element is a 3x3 block. The input matrix is placed in certain positions in this 3x3 grid. For Example 0, the input is placed on the diagonal. For Example 1, it's placed in (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). For Example 2, it's placed in (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nThe pattern in Example 0's input is that all diagonal elements are the same. The diagonal elements are 3,3,3. Example 1's diagonal is 8,3,8. Example 2's diagonal is 6,6,8. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: each example's output has the input matrix placed in positions corresponding to the positions where the elements in the input matrix's diagonal are equal to a certain value. For example, in Example 0, diagonal elements are 3, so placed on the diagonal blocks. In Example 1, the diagonal has 8,3,8. So maybe the first and third diagonal blocks are filled. But this doesn't explain Example 1's output fully.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times the input matrix is placed in the output depends on the number of times the diagonal elements appear in the input. For Example 0, the diagonal has three 3s, so placed three times. But in Example 0's output, it's placed three times. Example 1's diagonal has two 8s and one 3, and it's placed multiple times. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to place the input matrix in every position where the row and column index modulo 3 equals some value derived from the input's elements. This is too vague.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, each block is the same as the input matrix. In Example 1's output, the blocks are also the same as the input matrix. So the input matrix is replicated in different blocks. So the pattern is about where to place the input matrix in the output's 3x3 block structure.\n\nThe key is to determine, for each example, which blocks in the 3x3 grid are filled with the input matrix. Once we know that, we can generate the output.\n\nSo, for Example 0, filled blocks are (0,0), (1,1), (2,2).\n\nExample 1: (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nExample 2: (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nWhat's common between these? Let's look at the input matrices.\n\nExample 0's input:\n\n3 8 7\n\n9 3 8\n\n7 9 3\n\nThe diagonal elements are 3,3,3. So all diagonal elements are the same. The output has diagonal blocks filled.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\n8 6 8\n\n3 3 8\n\n8 8 8\n\nThe diagonal elements are 8,3,8. The first and third diagonal elements are 8. The output has blocks (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Not sure.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\n6 9 9\n\n4 6 8\n\n9 9 8\n\nDiagonal elements are 6,6,8. The first two are 6, third is 8. The filled blocks are (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1). Hmm.\n\nNot seeing a connection. Another angle: perhaps the sum of each row or column determines the block positions.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times each row is replicated in the output depends on the row's maximum element. For example, in Example 0, the max is 8,9,9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input matrix as a 3x3 grid, and the output as a larger grid where each element is replaced by a 3x3 block. If the original element is even, replace it with the input matrix; if odd, replace with zeros. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nFor Example 0's input, which has even and odd elements. But the output has the input matrix in diagonal blocks. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is constructed by creating a larger matrix where each element in the input is replaced by a 3x3 block. For example, in Example 0, each element in the input is replaced by a 3x3 matrix, which is either the original element (but that's a single number) or a zero matrix. But this doesn't align with the outputs.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 matrix where each element is a 3x3 block, and the entire input matrix is placed in certain blocks based on a pattern. For example, in Example 0, the input is placed in the diagonal blocks. In Example 1, it's placed in the corners and the bottom row. In Example 2, it's placed in the top middle, top right, bottom left, and bottom middle.\n\nBut how to determine this pattern from the input?\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to find a different approach. Let's think of each output row as a combination of multiple copies of the input rows. For example, in Example 1's first output row, the first and third blocks are filled with the input's first row. So perhaps the number of copies is determined by the number of times a particular element appears in the input row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is transformed into three output rows, each with the row placed in a different block, and this is done for each row, resulting in 9 output rows. But this doesn't explain why some blocks are filled multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 matrix of 3x3 blocks, and the input matrix is placed in blocks where the row and column indices match certain criteria based on the input's elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by rotating the input matrix and placing it in different positions. For example, rotating the input matrix 0 degrees, 120 degrees, 240 degrees, but this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll try to look for a different angle.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, each block is the original matrix. So it's a block diagonal matrix with three copies. Example 1's output is more complex, but the input has the third row being all 8s. Maybe the number of non-zero blocks depends on the presence of duplicate elements in the input rows.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the input matrix is placed in the output matrix such that each block in the output corresponds to a possible shift of the input rows. For example, each block represents a cyclic shift of the original rows.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given that time is limited, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1, 1, 7]\n\n[7, 4, 1]\n\n[5, 1, 7]\n\nLooking for patterns in the training examples, perhaps each row is replicated in three different positions in the output, but the positions depend on the number of duplicates in the row.\n\nThe first row [1,1,7] has two 1s. Maybe it's placed in two blocks per output row. The second row [7,4,1] has all unique elements, so placed in one block. The third row [5,1,7] has all unique elements (assuming 5,1,7 are distinct), so placed in one block.\n\nBut how does this translate to the output structure?\n\nLooking at Example 1, where the third row was all 8s and was placed in all three blocks. So perhaps the number of duplicates determines the number of blocks per row.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst row has two duplicates \u2192 placed in two blocks per output row.\n\nSecond row all unique \u2192 placed in one block per output row.\n\nThird row all unique \u2192 placed in one block per output row.\n\nBut how are these blocks arranged?\n\nLooking at Example 1's first row, which has two duplicates, the output rows for that row have the row in two blocks (first and third) in the first three output rows, then one block in the middle, then all three. But this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each row:\n\n- Number of duplicates + 1 = number of blocks filled.\n\nSo first row has two duplicates \u2192 2 + 1 = 3 blocks filled? But Example 1's first row has two duplicates and is filled in two blocks in the first output rows. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if a row has n duplicates, it's placed in n+1 blocks. For the first row of the test input (two duplicates), that's three blocks. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of copies is based on the number of occurrences of the most frequent element in the row. For example, if the most frequent element occurs m times, the row is placed in m blocks.\n\nTest input first row: most frequent is 1 (twice) \u2192 two blocks.\n\nSecond row: all elements unique \u2192 one block.\n\nThird row: all unique \u2192 one block.\n\nSo each output row would have the input row placed in two blocks for the first row, and one for others.\n\nBut how to arrange this?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the first row (two duplicates) is placed in two blocks in the first three output rows, then one in the middle, then three in the last. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, the number of blocks filled in each output row is equal to the number of duplicates in the row plus one. So:\n\nTest input first row has two duplicates \u2192 three blocks filled per output row.\n\nBut this doesn't align with the training examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the closest example.\n\nLooking at the test input's first row: [1,1,7], which has two duplicates. Looking at Example 1's first row (two duplicates), the output for that row starts with two copies in the first and third blocks. So maybe the test input's first row will be placed in two blocks per output row. The second and third rows, with unique elements, will be placed in one block.\n\nBut how to arrange them in the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each input row is placed in the output in three different positions: the original position, shifted by three, and shifted by six. But in Example 0, it's the case, and in Example 1, the same row is placed multiple times in different positions.\n\nBut without a clear rule, I'll have to proceed with a guess.\n\nGiven the test input, perhaps the output will have the input matrix placed in a diagonal pattern like Example 0, but this is a guess. Alternatively, since the test input's third row is [5,1,7], which is the same as the first row except for the first element, maybe it's placed similarly to Example 0.\n\nSo, if the output is a block diagonal matrix, then each diagonal block is the input matrix, leading to:\n\n[1,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[7,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,1,1,7,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,1,7,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4,1]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\nBut this is similar to Example 0's output. However, looking at the other examples, this pattern isn't consistent. For example, Example 1's output is different. So why would the test input follow Example 0's pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is determined by the presence of certain elements. For example, if the input matrix has a certain number of duplicates, the output is diagonal. If not, it's different.\n\nBut without a clear rule, this is risky. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the diagonal block pattern for the test input.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nThe input is a 3x3 matrix:\n[3,8,7]\n[9,3,8]\n[7,9,3]\n\nThe output is a 9x9 matrix. Let me check how the original elements are placed. The first three rows of the output have the original first row followed by zeros. Then the next three rows have the original second row shifted to the right by three positions, then zeros. The last three rows have the third row shifted by six positions. Wait, but looking closer, each 3x3 block in the output corresponds to the original matrix placed in a diagonal fashion. Like the first 3 rows have the original matrix in the top-left block, the next three in the middle block, and the last three in the bottom-right block. So each original row is placed in a new row of the output, but shifted to form a larger matrix where each original row is in a diagonal block. But wait, the output in Example 0 has 9 rows, each being a 9-element array. Let me visualize it.\n\nOriginal matrix rows are placed in the output's blocks. The first three rows of the output are the first original row in block 1, then zeros. The fourth to sixth rows have the second original row in the fourth position (maybe middle block?), and the seventh to ninth rows have the third original row in the seventh position (last block). Wait, maybe it's a 3x3 grid of blocks where each original row is placed diagonally. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe each row of the input is transformed into three rows in the output, arranged in such a way that each input row is placed in a diagonal block of the output matrix. For instance, in Example 0, the output has 9 rows. Each original row is replicated three times in the output, but each time shifted to a different block. Let's look:\n\nThe first three rows of the output are:\n\n[3,8,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[9,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[7,9,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThen the next three rows are:\n\n[0,0,0,3,8,7,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,9,3,8,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,7,9,3,0,0,0]\n\nThen the last three:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,7]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,9,3,8]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,7,9,3]\n\nSo each of the original rows is placed in a diagonal block. The first block is top-left, then middle, then bottom-right. But each original row is used three times. Wait, in the first output block, each row of the input is placed as the first three elements of each row in the output. Then the middle block is shifted by three positions, and the last by six.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input rows? For example 0, each original row is placed in the same position in each of the three blocks. Wait, maybe the input rows are arranged in three different positions in the output matrix, each in their own 3x3 block. But the output has three blocks along the diagonal, each being a copy of the original matrix. Wait, but in the first three rows of the output, each row is the first row of the input followed by zeros, then the next three rows are the second row shifted, etc. So maybe the original matrix is being placed three times along the diagonal of a larger 9x9 matrix. But each original row is split into three parts? Wait, no. Wait, the output is a 9x9 matrix, but each of the input's rows are expanded into three rows each. So the original 3 rows become 9 rows in the output. Each input row is repeated three times in the output, but each time shifted to a different horizontal block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row of the input is used to create three rows in the output, each time placed in a different 3-element segment. For example, the first input row [3,8,7] becomes the first three elements of the first three output rows. Then the next three output rows have this row shifted to the middle three positions. Then the last three rows have it shifted to the last three positions. But that doesn't fit with example 0's output. Let me check example 0 again.\n\nWait, in example 0's output, the first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: [3,8,7, 0,0,0, 0,0,0]\nRow 1: [9,3,8, 0,0,0, 0,0,0]\nRow 2: [7,9,3, 0,0,0, 0,0,0]\n\nSo these are the original three rows of the input, each followed by six zeros. Then the next three rows:\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0, 3,8,7, 0,0,0]\nRow 4: [0,0,0, 9,3,8, 0,0,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,0, 7,9,3, 0,0,0]\n\nThese are the original rows placed in the middle three positions. Then rows 6-8:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,7]\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,9,3,8]\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,9,3]\n\nSo each original row is placed in three different positions in the output: first block (positions 0-2), then middle (3-5), then last (6-8). But how are these positions determined? It seems that for each original row, there's a copy in each of the three blocks, but the order is such that each block corresponds to the entire original matrix. Wait, the output is a 9x9 matrix arranged as three 3x3 blocks along the diagonal. Each block is the original matrix. But no, in example 0's output, the first three rows have the first row of the input, then the next three rows have the second row, etc. But each of those blocks is the original matrix. Wait, no. The first three rows are the original rows in the first block, then the next three rows are the original rows shifted to the middle block, and the last three rows are shifted to the last block. So the entire output is a 9x9 matrix where each 3x3 block along the diagonal is the original matrix. But in that case, the output would have three copies of the original matrix. But looking at example 0's output, each of the three blocks (top-left, middle-middle, bottom-right) is the original matrix. So the output is a 3x3 arrangement of 3x3 blocks, where each block is the original matrix but placed in diagonal positions, and the rest filled with zeros. Wait, but in example 0's output, each diagonal block is the original matrix. So the first three rows (rows 0-2) have the first block (positions 0-2) as the original matrix's rows. Then rows 3-5 have the middle block (positions 3-5) as the original matrix's rows. Then rows 6-8 have the last block (positions 6-8) as the original matrix's rows. So the output is a 9x9 matrix where each of the three diagonal 3x3 blocks is the original matrix, and the rest are zeros. But how does that fit with the input?\n\nWait, but the input in example 0 is a 3x3 matrix, and the output is a 9x9 matrix where each of the three 3x3 blocks along the diagonal is the original matrix. That would mean that the output is a block diagonal matrix with three copies of the input. But looking at the output rows:\n\nEach row in the output corresponds to a row from the input matrix, repeated three times with shifts. For example, the first row of the output is the first input row followed by six zeros. Then, in the middle block, the first input row is placed starting at position 3, but only the first three elements. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nNo, the first three rows of the output are the original three rows each in the first block (positions 0-2). The next three rows (rows 3-5) are the original rows in the middle block (positions 3-5). The last three rows (6-8) are the original rows in the last block (positions 6-8). So each row of the input is placed in three different positions in the output. But this would require that the output has three times the number of rows as the input. Since the input is 3 rows, the output is 9 rows. Each input row is placed in three different output rows, each time shifted to a different block.\n\nWait, but the input in example 0 is 3x3, and the output is 9x9. Each row of the input becomes three rows in the output, each shifted to a different block. So the first row of the input is placed in the first three rows of the output, but each time in a different block. Wait, but in example 0's output, the first three rows are the original three rows in the first block. Then the next three rows are the original three rows in the middle block. Then the last three rows are the original three rows in the last block. So essentially, the entire original matrix is placed three times in the diagonal blocks of the output matrix. So the output is a block diagonal matrix with three copies of the input. But how does that explain the output structure?\n\nWait, the output for example 0 is:\n\nRows 0-2: original rows in first block.\n\nRows 3-5: original rows in middle block.\n\nRows 6-8: original rows in last block.\n\nSo each block is a 3x3 matrix, and the output is a 9x9 matrix with three blocks along the diagonal, each being the original matrix. But that would mean that the output is a 3x3 arrangement of blocks, each 3x3. So the output is:\n\nBlock (1,1): original matrix.\n\nBlock (2,2): original matrix.\n\nBlock (3,3): original matrix.\n\nBut in example 0, that's exactly what's happening. So the pattern is to create a block diagonal matrix with three copies of the original matrix, arranged along the diagonal, and the rest filled with zeros. But in the first example, let's check.\n\nExample 1's input is:\n\n[8,6,8]\n\n[3,3,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nThe output has 9 rows, each 9 elements. Let's look at the output rows.\n\nFirst three rows:\n\n[8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8]\n\n[3,3,8,0,0,0,3,3,8]\n\n[8,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8]\n\nHmm, these are the original rows followed by three zeros and then the same original row again. Then the next three rows:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8]\n\nThese are all zeros in the first six positions, then the original rows. Then the last three rows:\n\n[8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8]\n\n[3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThese rows have the original elements repeated three times? For example, the first of these rows is [8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8], which is the original first row repeated three times. Similarly for the others.\n\nSo this doesn't fit the block diagonal pattern of example 0. So the pattern must be different. So maybe the way the input is transformed depends on some other property. Let's see if there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The first three rows have the original row in positions 0-2 and 6-8, with zeros in between. The next three rows have the original row in positions 6-8. The last three rows have the original row repeated three times. Wait, perhaps the pattern here is that each input row is placed in specific blocks. For example, each row is replicated in certain blocks, perhaps based on the position of the row in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the input is transformed into three rows in the output, each shifted by a certain number of positions. But the shifts vary between examples, so that can't be the case.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput is:\n\n[6,9,9]\n\n[4,6,8]\n\n[9,9,8]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0,6,9,9,6,9,9]\n\n[0,0,0,4,6,8,4,6,8]\n\n[0,0,0,9,9,8,9,9,8]\n\nThen three rows of zeros, then three rows with the original rows in the first and second blocks.\n\nWait, this seems different again. The first three rows have the original row in positions 3-5 and 6-8. Then three rows of zeros. Then three rows with the original rows in positions 0-2 and 3-5. So perhaps the arrangement varies based on the input's content.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to find a common pattern.\n\nLooking for a general rule across all examples.\n\nIn example 0: the output is three diagonal blocks, each being the original matrix. Each row of the input is placed in three different positions (blocks) in the output.\n\nIn example 1: The first three rows have the original row in the first and third blocks. The middle three rows have the original row in the third block. The last three rows have the original row in all three blocks.\n\nIn example 2: The first three rows have the original row in the middle and last blocks. Then zeros. Then the last three rows have the original row in the first and middle blocks.\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. There must be another pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: look at the positions where the original elements are placed in the output.\n\nFor example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: positions 0-2: [3,8,7], rest zeros.\n\nRow 3: positions 3-5: [3,8,7]\n\nRow 6: positions 6-8: [3,8,7]\n\nSimilarly for the other rows. So each row of the input is placed three times in the output, each time in a different third of the output row.\n\nBut each output row corresponds to an input row shifted by 0, 3, or 6 positions. But how are the output rows generated?\n\nWait, example 0's output has 9 rows, each of length 9. Each input row is used three times in the output, each time shifted by 0, 3, or 6 positions. So for the first input row [3,8,7], there are three output rows where this row is placed starting at positions 0, 3, and 6. Similarly for the other input rows.\n\nBut looking at example 0's output, the first three output rows are the input rows shifted by 0, then the next three are shifted by 3, and the last three shifted by 6. So each input row is placed in three different positions, each shifted by 0, 3, 6, but this is done per output row.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by taking each input row and creating three copies of it in the output, each shifted by 0, 3, or 6 positions. But then the total rows would be 3x3=9. So each input row generates three output rows, each shifted by different amounts.\n\nIn example 0:\n\nInput row 0: [3,8,7] \u2192 output rows:\n\n[3,8,7,0,0,0,0,0,0] (shift 0)\n\n[0,0,0,3,8,7,0,0,0] (shift 3)\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,7] (shift 6)\n\nBut wait, no. The first three output rows are the three input rows each shifted by 0. Then the next three are each shifted by 3. Then the last three shifted by 6. So for each input row, there's three output rows: one shifted by 0, then another shifted by 3, then another shifted by 6. But this would require that each input row is spread across three output rows with different shifts.\n\nBut example 0's output is exactly this. So for each input row, create three output rows where the row is placed at shifts 0,3,6 respectively. Then arrange them in order. So input row 0 becomes output rows 0, 3, 6. Input row 1 becomes output rows 1,4,7. Input row 2 becomes output rows 2,5,8. Then the output rows are arranged as all the shifted versions of the input rows.\n\nIn example 0, the output rows are ordered as:\n\nRow 0: input row 0 shifted 0.\n\nRow 1: input row 1 shifted 0.\n\nRow 2: input row 2 shifted 0.\n\nRow 3: input row 0 shifted 3.\n\nRow 4: input row 1 shifted 3.\n\nRow 5: input row 2 shifted 3.\n\nRow 6: input row 0 shifted 6.\n\nRow7: input row 1 shifted 6.\n\nRow8: input row 2 shifted 6.\n\nBut looking at example 0's output, that's exactly what's happening. So the pattern is that each input row is shifted by 0, 3, 6 and placed into three different output rows. Then all these shifted rows are grouped in the order of the original input rows followed by their shifts.\n\nBut how does this explain example 1 and example 2?\n\nLet's check example 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n[8,6,8]\n\n[3,3,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nThe output's first three rows are:\n\n[8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8] \u2192 input row 0 shifted by 0 and 6.\n\n[3,3,8,0,0,0,3,3,8] \u2192 input row1 shifted by 0 and 6.\n\n[8,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8] \u2192 input row2 shifted by 0 and 6.\n\nThen rows 3-5:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8] \u2192 input row0 shifted by 6 only?\n\nWait, row3 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8], which is input row0 shifted by 6.\n\nRow4: same for input row1.\n\nRow5: same for input row2.\n\nThen rows6-8:\n\n[8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8] \u2192 input row0 shifted by 0, 3, and 6.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nHmm, this seems different. So in example1, the shifts are not 0,3,6 for each input row. Instead, the first three output rows have shifts 0 and 6. The next three have shift 6. The last three have shifts 0,3,6, but perhaps with overlapping.\n\nSo maybe the pattern varies between examples. This complicates things.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output is created by tiling the input matrix in a specific way. For example, in example0, the output is three copies of the input matrix placed along the diagonal. But in example1, the output has the input matrix placed in the first and third blocks of the first three rows, then in the third block for the middle rows, and tiled in all three blocks for the last rows. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some transformation of the input matrix into a larger matrix where each element is replaced by a 3x3 block. For example, each element in the input becomes a 3x3 block in the output. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, example0's input is 3x3. The output is 9x9. If each element in the input is replaced by a 3x3 block, then the output would be 3x3 blocks arranged in a 3x3 grid, which would be 9x9. But how?\n\nFor instance, the element 3 in the input (0,0) would become a 3x3 block. But how to determine the values in that block. \n\nLooking at example0's output, the first three rows have [3,8,7] in the first three positions. Then zeros. The next three rows have [3,8,7] in positions 3-5, and so on. It's possible that each element in the input matrix is placed in a diagonal position within its corresponding block, and the rest of the block is zeros. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by arranging the input matrix's rows in different positions of the output rows, with shifts based on the row's position. For example, the first three output rows are the input rows shifted by 0, the next three by 3, and the last three by 6. But in example1, some rows have multiple shifts. Like row0 of the output for example1 has the input row0 shifted by 0 and 6. So this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, the shifts might be determined by the value of the elements themselves. For example, in example1, the input has elements like 8, 6, 3, etc., which might correspond to the number of shifts. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the output dimensions. All examples have input as 3x3 matrices and output as 9x9 matrices. So each output row has 9 elements, and there are 9 rows. So the output is 9x9, and the input is 3x3. So the transformation involves expanding the input into a larger matrix by a factor of 3 in each dimension.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn example0, the output can be seen as three 3x3 blocks arranged diagonally. Each block is the original input matrix. So the output is a block diagonal matrix with three instances of the input.\n\nIn example1, the output's first three rows have two copies of the input rows (first and third block), then the middle three rows have one copy (third block), and the last three rows have three copies (each block). So the pattern here is different.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that there's another pattern. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at example0's output, the three blocks are the original matrix. Example1's output has the original matrix in the first and third blocks of the first three rows, then in the third block of the middle rows, and in all three blocks of the last rows. Example2's output has the original matrix in the middle and third blocks of the first three rows, then all zeros, then in the first and middle blocks of the last three rows.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each row of the input is replicated in the output, but the position where it's placed depends on the row's index.\n\nFor example, in example0:\n\nRow0 of input is placed in blocks 0, 1, 2 (but in example0, it's in block 0, then block1, then block2). Wait, example0's output's first three rows are input rows in block0, next three in block1, then block2.\n\nIn example1's first three rows, each input row is in block0 and block2. Then in the next three rows, in block2. Then in the last three rows, all three blocks.\n\nExample2's first three rows have input rows in block1 and block2. Then zeros. Then input rows in block0 and block1.\n\nHmm, this is getting too vague. Let's try to find a mathematical pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Each output row is formed by concatenating three copies of the input row, each multiplied by a certain mask. For example, in example0, the masks are [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1], so each copy is placed in a different third of the output row. But in example1, the first three rows have masks [1,0,1], then [0,0,1], then [1,1,1]. \n\nAlternatively, the output is a Kronecker product of the input matrix with some pattern. But example0's output is three copies along the diagonal, which could be the Kronecker product with a 3x3 identity matrix. But let's check:\n\nKronecker product of input matrix I with identity matrix of size 3 would create a 9x9 matrix where each element of I is replaced by a 3x3 block, with the element multiplied by the identity. But example0's output is exactly this. The input matrix is 3x3, the identity is 3x3, so the Kronecker product would be a 9x9 matrix with three diagonal blocks, each being the original input matrix. Which matches example0's output. So for example0, the output is input \u2297 I, where I is the identity matrix.\n\nBut then why does example1's output not follow this pattern? Let's see. Example1's input is:\n\n8 6 8\n\n3 3 8\n\n8 8 8\n\nThe Kronecker product with identity would result in three diagonal blocks of the input matrix. But example1's output has more blocks. For instance, the first three rows have the input row in both the first and third blocks. This suggests that the Kronecker product isn't the pattern here.\n\nSo maybe the pattern varies between examples. Alternatively, perhaps the Kronecker product is with a different matrix each time. For example, in example1, maybe the Kronecker product is with a matrix that has 1s in the first and third positions.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example1's output:\n\nThe first three rows have the input row in positions 0-2 and 6-8, which are the first and third thirds. The next three rows have the input row in the third third. The last three rows have the input row in all three thirds.\n\nSo perhaps for example1, the output is generated by concatenating the input row with zeros and the input row again for the first three rows. Then, for the middle three rows, it's zeros followed by the input row. Then for the last three rows, the input row repeated three times.\n\nBut why? What's the rule here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of times each row is replicated depends on the sum or some property of the row. Let's check:\n\nIn example0, the input rows are [3,8,7], sum=18; [9,3,8], sum=20; [7,9,3], sum=19. The output has each row shifted three times. Not sure if the sum is relevant.\n\nExample1's input rows have sums 22, 14, 24. Not obvious.\n\nExample2's input rows sum 24, 18, 26. Not seeing a pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is constructed by some kind of convolution or sliding window of the input rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the positions where the input elements appear in the output.\n\nFor example0, each element of the input appears three times in the output, at positions (0,0), (3,3), (6,6) for the element 3. Similarly, other elements are placed along the diagonal of each block.\n\nBut in example1, the element 8 from the first row is placed in positions (0,0), (0,6), (6,0), (6,3), (6,6), etc. So perhaps the position depends on the row and column indices in the input.\n\nAlternatively, each element in the input matrix is placed in the output at positions (3*i + k, 3*j + k) for k in 0,1,2. But this might be a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, each row of the input is expanded into three rows in the output, each shifted by 0,3,6 positions. Then, each column of the input is expanded into three columns in the output. But this would create a 9x9 matrix where each element is in a 3x3 block. But in example0, this is the case. So maybe the pattern is that the output is the Kronecker product of the input matrix with a 3x3 identity matrix. But example1's output doesn't fit this.\n\nExample0's output is:\n\nOriginal matrix in (0-2,0-2), (3-5,3-5), (6-8,6-8). Which matches Kronecker product with identity matrix.\n\nExample1's output has the original matrix in more positions. For example, in the first three rows, the original rows are in 0-2 and 6-8 columns. So this is not just diagonal blocks. Therefore, the pattern must be different.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is generated by arranging the input rows in a 3x3 grid, where each cell in the grid is the input row shifted by a certain amount. For example, in example0, the grid is diagonal, each cell is the input row shifted by 0, 3, or 6. But this isn't clear.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at example2's output, the first three rows have the original rows in the middle and last thirds. The last three rows have them in the first and middle thirds. The middle three rows are all zeros. So perhaps the pattern is that the input rows are placed in certain thirds based on their position. For example, the first input row is placed in the middle and last thirds for the first three output rows. The second input row is placed in the middle and last thirds for the next three output rows. The third input row is placed in the middle and last thirds for the last three output rows. But this doesn't fit example0's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by combining shifted versions of the input matrix. For example, in example0, it's three shifted versions (no shift, shifted right by 3, shifted right by 6). But then the output is a combination of these shifts.\n\nBut how to determine which shifts to apply.\n\nAlternatively, the number of shifts is determined by the row index modulo 3. For example0, each row is shifted 0, 3, 6 times. For example1, maybe the shifts are different. But I'm not seeing the pattern.\n\nLet me think about the test input:\n\nTest input is:\n\n[1, 1, 7]\n\n[7,4,1]\n\n[5,1,7]\n\nThe output should be in the same format as the training examples. So I need to apply the pattern observed from the training examples.\n\nBut given the examples are inconsistent, I need to find a common rule.\n\nLooking back at example0 and example1:\n\nExample0's output has each input row appearing three times in the output, each shifted by 0, 3, 6.\n\nExample1's output has each input row appearing in the first three rows with shifts 0 and 6, then in the middle three rows with shift 6, then in the last three rows with shifts 0,3,6.\n\nExample2's output has each input row in shifts 3 and 6 for the first three rows, then shifts 0 and 3 for the last three rows.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern may involve certain shifts that depend on the input's elements. But this is not obvious.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the number of copies of each row in the output depends on the elements in the row. For example, in example1, the first row is [8,6,8]. The output for this row has three copies: first in positions 0-2 and 6-8 (shifts 0 and 6), then shift 6, then shifts 0,3,6. But how does this relate to the elements?\n\nAlternatively, the shifts are determined by the row index and the column index of the input matrix.\n\nAnother possible approach: look for the output as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. Each block is either the original matrix or zeros. For example0, the blocks on the diagonal are the original matrix. For example1, the blocks in positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are the original matrix. For example2, the blocks in (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1) are the original matrix.\n\nBut how to determine which blocks are filled.\n\nAlternatively, the filled blocks in the output correspond to the positions where the input's elements meet certain criteria. For example, if an element is even, its block is filled. But this is speculative.\n\nIn example0, all elements are used in all blocks, so maybe no such filter.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a combination of cyclic shifts of the input matrix. For example, the first three rows are shifted by 0, the next by 1, and the next by 2. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by rotating the input matrix and placing it in certain blocks. For example, each block is a rotation of the input. But example0's blocks are not rotated, just copied.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Let me try to find a different angle.\n\nLooking at example0 and example1:\n\nIn example0's output, the first three rows are the input rows in the first third. The next three are the same rows in the middle third. The last three are in the last third.\n\nIn example1's output, the first three rows have the input rows in the first and last thirds. The next three have them in the last third. The last three have them in all three thirds.\n\nIn example2's output, the first three have the input rows in the middle and last thirds. The middle three are all zeros. The last three have the input rows in the first and middle thirds.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is divided into three horizontal sections (each three rows), and each section has the input rows placed in certain thirds (columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8) of the output rows. The placement varies between examples.\n\nThe question is: what determines which thirds are filled in each section for a given input?\n\nLooking for a pattern in the sections:\n\nExample0:\n\nSection 0 (rows0-2): first third filled.\n\nSection1 (rows3-5): middle third filled.\n\nSection2 (rows6-8): last third filled.\n\nExample1:\n\nSection0: first and last thirds filled.\n\nSection1: last third filled.\n\nSection2: all thirds filled.\n\nExample2:\n\nSection0: middle and last thirds filled.\n\nSection1: all zeros.\n\nSection2: first and middle thirds filled.\n\nThis seems inconsistent, but perhaps there's a pattern based on the input's elements.\n\nLooking at example1's input:\n\nFirst row: [8,6,8] \u2192 contains two 8's.\n\nSecond row: [3,3,8] \u2192 two 3's.\n\nThird row: [8,8,8] \u2192 all 8's.\n\nMaybe the number of repeated elements in the row determines which thirds are filled. For example, if a row has two of the same elements, then fill two thirds. But example0's rows don't have repeated elements, but the sections are filled with one third each.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the row modulo 3 determines the sections. \n\nExample0 row0 sum: 3+8+7=18 \u2192 18 mod 3=0.\n\nExample1 row0 sum: 8+6+8=22 \u2192 22 mod3=1.\n\nExample2 row0 sum:6+9+9=24 \u2192 24 mod3=0.\n\nNot sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, the number of even elements in the row.\n\nExample0 row0: 3 (odd),8 (even),7 (odd) \u2192 1 even.\n\nExample1 row0: 8,6,8 \u2192 all even.\n\nExample2 row0:6,9,9 \u2192 1 even.\n\nBut how does this relate to the output sections filled.\n\nAnother approach: The pattern might involve the position of the row in the input matrix and the position of the section in the output.\n\nFor example, in example0:\n\nInput row 0 is placed in section0's first third, section1's middle third, and section2's last third. So each input row is placed in a diagonal manner across the sections.\n\nBut example1 doesn't follow this.\n\nAlternatively, each input row is replicated in the output sections based on its index. For example, input row i is placed in section i's certain thirds. But example0 has three sections, each corresponding to input row0, row1, row2. But example0's sections are filled with all input rows.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps the pattern is that the output is a 3x3 grid of blocks, where each block is either the original input matrix or zeros, and the positions of the blocks are determined by some property of the input.\n\nLooking at example0's output: diagonal blocks are input matrix.\n\nExample1's output: first row of blocks has input matrix in first and third blocks; second row has input matrix in third block; third row has input matrix in all three blocks.\n\nExample2's output: first row of blocks has input matrix in middle and third blocks; second row of blocks is all zeros; third row has input matrix in first and middle blocks.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the placement of blocks depends on the original input's values. But without a clear mathematical relation, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is a 3x3 grid of blocks, where each block (i,j) is the original input matrix multiplied by the (i,j) element of some other matrix derived from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by concatenating certain combinations of the input rows. For example, each section of three rows in the output is a combination of the input rows shifted and possibly multiplied by some factor.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not found a clear pattern, perhaps I need to look for another approach. Let's look for the following in each example:\n\nEach output row is formed by concatenating three segments. Each segment is either the original input row or zeros. The pattern of which segments are filled varies between examples.\n\nFor example, in example0, each section of three output rows fills one segment. In example1, the first section fills first and third segments, second section fills third segment, third section fills all segments. In example2, first section fills middle and third, third section fills first and middle.\n\nBut how to determine which segments are filled for a given input?\n\nLooking at the input of example0: all rows are unique. Example1's first row has two 8's, third row all 8's. Example2's first row has two 9's, third row two 9's and an 8.\n\nPerhaps the segments filled depend on the number of times the most frequent element in the row appears.\n\nExample0 row0: elements 3,8,7 \u2192 all unique. So one segment filled.\n\nExample1 row0: 8,6,8 \u2192 two 8's. So two segments filled.\n\nExample2 row0:6,9,9 \u2192 two 9's. So two segments filled.\n\nSimilarly, example1's row2 has three 8's \u2192 three segments filled.\n\nExample2's row2:9,9,8 \u2192 two 9's. So two segments filled.\n\nExample0's row0: no duplicates \u2192 one segment filled.\n\nIf this is the case, then the number of segments filled for each row is equal to the maximum frequency of any element in that row.\n\nFor example:\n\nExample0 row0: max frequency 1 \u2192 one segment.\n\nExample1 row0: max frequency 2 \u2192 two segments.\n\nExample1 row2: max frequency 3 \u2192 three segments.\n\nExample2 row0: max frequency 2 \u2192 two segments.\n\nThen, the segments are filled in the output rows based on this frequency. For example:\n\nIf a row's max frequency is 1, then fill one segment in each section.\n\nIf max frequency is 2, fill two segments per section.\n\nBut I need to check if this aligns with the examples.\n\nExample0's output: each row's max frequency is 1 (all unique), so each section (three rows) fills one segment. Which matches example0's output.\n\nExample1's row0 has max frequency 2 \u2192 two segments filled in its output rows. In example1's output, the first three rows (for input row0) have two segments filled (first and third).\n\nRow1 of example1's input: [3,3,8] \u2192 max frequency 2 \u2192 two segments. In the output's first three rows (row1 of output), two segments filled (first and third).\n\nRow2 of example1's input: [8,8,8] \u2192 max frequency 3 \u2192 three segments filled. In example1's output's last three rows (row2 of input), all three segments are filled.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow0: [6,9,9] \u2192 max frequency 2 \u2192 two segments. In example2's output, first three rows for row0 have two segments filled (middle and third).\n\nRow1: [4,6,8] \u2192 max frequency 1 \u2192 one segment. In example2's output's middle three rows (row1 of input), one segment filled (but in example2, these rows are all zeros). Hmm, this contradicts.\n\nWait, example2's output's first three rows are for input row0 (max freq 2), middle three rows for input row1 (max freq 1), but they are all zeros, and last three rows for input row2 (max freq 2).\n\nBut according to the earlier hypothesis, input row1 (max freq 1) should have one segment filled. However, in example2's output, the middle three rows (corresponding to input row1) are all zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the segments filled depend on the max frequency of the entire matrix, not per row. Or maybe another criteria.\n\nAlternatively, the segments filled in each section (three output rows) correspond to the max frequency in the corresponding input row. For example:\n\nIn example1's input:\n\nRow0: max frequency 2 \u2192 two segments filled in its output section.\n\nRow1: max frequency 2 \u2192 two segments filled.\n\nRow2: max frequency 3 \u2192 three segments filled.\n\nBut in example1's output, row0's section (first three rows) have two segments filled, row1's section (next three) have one segment filled (third), which doesn't align.\n\nSo this hypothesis might be incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: The number of segments filled in each output row is equal to the number of times the row's elements appear in the entire input matrix.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the segments are filled in a way that the sum of the elements in the input row determines the position. For example, sum modulo 3 determines which segments are filled. Let's check:\n\nExample0 row0 sum 18 mod3=0 \u2192 segments 0.\n\nExample1 row0 sum 22 mod3=1 \u2192 segments 0 and 2.\n\nExample2 row0 sum 24 mod3=0 \u2192 segments 1 and 2.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, the segments filled are determined by the digits in the elements. For example, if the elements have certain digits, they're placed in certain segments. But this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that time is limited, perhaps I should make a guess based on the test input.\n\nTest input is:\n\n[1,1,7]\n\n[7,4,1]\n\n[5,1,7]\n\nLooking at each row's max frequency:\n\nRow0: [1,1,7] \u2192 max frequency 2 (two 1's).\n\nRow1: [7,4,1] \u2192 max frequency 1 (each appears once).\n\nRow2: [5,1,7] \u2192 max frequency 1.\n\nSo according to the previous hypothesis, row0's output would have two segments filled in each of its three output rows, row1 and row2 would have one segment each.\n\nBut looking back to the examples, this may vary. For example, in example1, the row with max frequency 3 had three segments filled. So for test input, row0 (max frequency 2) would have two segments filled, and others one.\n\nBut how to determine which segments are filled. Looking at example1's row0, which has two segments filled in first and third positions. Example2's row0 has two segments filled in middle and third.\n\nSo perhaps the choice of segments depends on the actual elements. For example, if the row has duplicates, the segments filled are determined by the values of the elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the segments filled are the first and third if the duplicated elements are even, and middle and third if they are odd. \n\nExample1's row0 has duplicated 8's (even), so segments 0 and 2.\n\nExample2's row0 has duplicated 9's (odd), so segments 1 and 2.\n\nTest input's row0 has duplicated 1's (odd), so segments 1 and 2.\n\nIf this is the case, then for the test input's row0, the segments filled would be middle and third.\n\nRow1 and row2 of test input have max frequency 1, so one segment filled. Assuming for max frequency 1, the segment filled is determined by row index modulo 3.\n\nRow0 (index 0) for test input: two segments filled (1 and 2).\n\nRow1 (index1): one segment filled (maybe segment1).\n\nRow2 (index2): one segment filled (segment2).\n\nBut this is speculation.\n\nLooking back to example0, which has all rows with max frequency 1. The segments filled are 0, then 1, then 2, corresponding to the row index.\n\nIn example0's output:\n\nRow0's section (rows0-2) have segment0 filled.\n\nRow1's section (rows3-5) have segment1 filled.\n\nRow2's section (rows6-8) have segment2 filled.\n\nSo for rows with max frequency 1, the segment filled is the row index modulo3.\n\nFor rows with max frequency 2, the segments filled are determined by the duplicated element's parity. Even duplicates fill segments 0 and 2, odd fill segments 1 and 2.\n\nFor max frequency 3, fill all three segments.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [1,1,7] \u2192 max frequency 2, duplicated element is 1 (odd). So fill segments 1 and 2 (middle and last).\n\nRow1: [7,4,1] \u2192 max frequency 1. Row index 1 \u2192 segment1.\n\nRow2: [5,1,7] \u2192 max frequency 1. Row index2 \u2192 segment2.\n\nNow, the output would be structured as follows:\n\nFor row0's section (first three output rows):\n\nEach of the three rows in this section would have the input row0 in segments 1 and 2 (positions 3-5 and 6-8), and zeros elsewhere. But wait, example2's row0 (segments 1 and 2) has the input row in those segments. So the first three rows of the test output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,1,1,7,1,1,7]\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,7,4,1]\n\n[0,0,0,5,1,7,5,1,7]\n\nThen for row1's section (next three rows), since max frequency is 1, and row index1 \u2192 segment1. So each output row in this section would have the input row1 in segment1 (positions3-5):\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, in example0's section1 (row1 of input), each output row in section1 is the input row1 shifted to segment1. So example0's section1 has three rows, each being the input row1 shifted to segment1. So similarly, for the test input's row1, the next three rows would have the input row1 shifted to segment1.\n\nThen for row2's section (last three rows), input row2 with max frequency 1, row index2 \u2192 segment2. So each output row in this section has input row2 shifted to segment2 (positions6-8):\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\nPutting it all together, the test output would be:\n\nFirst three rows:\n\n[0,0,0,1,1,7,1,1,7]\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,7,4,1]\n\n[0,0,0,5,1,7,5,1,7]\n\nNext three rows:\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\nLast three rows:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\nBut let's compare this with the training examples.\n\nExample2's first three rows are:\n\n[0,0,0,6,9,9,6,9,9]\n\n[0,0,0,4,6,8,4,6,8]\n\n[0,0,0,9,9,8,9,9,8]\n\nWhich matches the pattern of row0 having max frequency 2 (segments 1 and 2 filled with the input row). So the test input's first three rows would have the input rows in segments1 and 2. So for row0, the output rows are:\n\n[0,0,0,1,1,7,1,1,7]\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,7,4,1]\n\n[0,0,0,5,1,7,5,1,7]\n\nYes. Then row1's section would have their input row in segment1:\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2's section would have input row2 in segment2:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,7]\n\nBut looking at example2's output, the last three rows are:\n\n[6,9,9,6,9,9,0,0,0]\n\n[4,6,8,4,6,8,0,0,0]\n\n[9,9,8,9,9,8,0,0,0]\n\nWhich is input rows in segments0 and1. This suggests that in example2's row2 (max frequency 2, odd duplicates), the segments filled are 0 and 1. But according to our previous hypothesis, max frequency 2 with odd duplicates would fill segments 1 and 2. This discrepancy indicates that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThus, there must be another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the segments filled for a row with max frequency 2 are determined by the value of the duplicated element modulo 2. Even \u2192 segments 0 and 2, odd \u2192 segments 0 and 1.\n\nBut in example2's row0: duplicated 9's (odd) \u2192 segments1 and2 filled. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the segments filled are the ones corresponding to the positions of the duplicated elements in the row. For example, if the first and second elements are the same, fill segments0 and1. If the second and third, fill1 and2. If first and third, fill0 and2.\n\nIn example1's row0: elements are 8,6,8. Duplicated at positions0 and2 \u2192 segments0 and2.\n\nExample2's row0: elements6,9,9. Duplicated at positions1 and2 \u2192 segments1 and2.\n\nTest input's row0: elements1,1,7 \u2192 duplicated at positions0 and1 \u2192 segments0 and1.\n\nBut example2's row0's segments filled are 1 and2, which matches the positions of the duplicates (1 and2). So for the test input's row0, duplicated at positions0 and1, segments0 and1 would be filled.\n\nBut in example2's output, the first three rows for row0 are:\n\n[0,0,0,6,9,9,6,9,9]\n\nWhich has segments1 and2 filled. But the duplicates are in positions1 and2 of the input row, which would be segments1 and2. So that fits.\n\nSo the segments filled correspond to the positions of the duplicated elements. If duplicates are in columns i and j of the input row, then the segments filled are i and j. Since each segment is a third of the output row (0-2, 3-5, 6-8), perhaps each segment corresponds to the input column.\n\nWait, each segment in the output is a third of the row. But how to map input columns to segments.\n\nAlternatively, each segment corresponds to the original row's position. Not sure.\n\nBut for the test input's row0: duplicated elements are in columns0 and1. So segments0 and1 (positions0-2 and3-5) would be filled. But in example2's row0, duplicated elements are in columns1 and2 \u2192 segments1 and2 filled (3-5 and6-8).\n\nThus, the segments filled correspond to the columns where the duplicated elements are in the input row.\n\nSo for example, in test input's row0: [1,1,7], duplicates at columns0 and1. So in the output, the first two segments (segments0 and1) are filled. The output row would have the input row in segments0 and1, and perhaps another segment.\n\nBut in example1's row0: [8,6,8], duplicates at columns0 and2. So segments0 and2 are filled.\n\nExample2's row0: [6,9,9], duplicates at columns1 and2 \u2192 segments1 and2 filled.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo the rule is: for each row in the input, if there are duplicates, the segments filled in the output are those corresponding to the columns of the duplicates. If no duplicates (max frequency 1), then fill the segment corresponding to the row's index modulo3.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow0: [1,1,7] \u2192 duplicates at columns0 and1 \u2192 fill segments0 and1.\n\nRow1: [7,4,1] \u2192 no duplicates \u2192 fill segment1 (row index1 modulo3).\n\nRow2: [5,1,7] \u2192 no duplicates \u2192 fill segment2 (row index2 modulo3).\n\nThus, the output would be structured as follows:\n\nFor row0's section (first three output rows):\n\nEach row is filled in segments0 and1 with the input row.\n\nSo the first three output rows would be:\n\n[1,1,7,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[7,4,1,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[5,1,7,5,1,7,0,0,0]\n\nWait, no. Each output row in the section corresponds to the input row, but filled in the specified segments. For row0's section (first three rows), each of the three input rows are processed:\n\nRow0 of input: segments0 and1 filled.\n\nRow1 of input: segments1 filled.\n\nRow2 of input: segments2 filled.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nEach input row generates three output rows in its section. For example, in example0, each input row's section has three output rows where the row is filled in one segment.\n\nSo for test input:\n\nRow0's section (first three output rows) would have each of the three input rows, but filled in segments0 and1 for row0's data.\n\nWait, perhaps the section for each input row consists of three output rows. Each output row in the section is filled in the segments determined by the input row's duplicate columns.\n\nBut how are the output rows generated for each input row.\n\nFor example, in example1's first three output rows, each row is filled with the input row0 in segments0 and2. So:\n\nRow0 of output: [8,6,8,0,0,0,8,6,8] \u2192 segments0 and2 filled with input row0.\n\nRow1 of output: [3,3,8,0,0,0,3,3,8] \u2192 input row1 in segments0 and2.\n\nRow2 of output: [8,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8] \u2192 input row2 in segments0 and2.\n\nThen, the next three rows are filled in segment2:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8] \u2192 input row0 in segment2.\n\nRow4: same for input row1.\n\nRow5: same for input row2.\n\nThe last three rows are filled in all segments:\n\nRow6: [8,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,8] \u2192 input row0 in all segments.\n\nRow7: same for input row1.\n\nRow8: same for input row2.\n\nSo for each input row, there are three output rows in their respective sections, each filled in different segments based on the max frequency and duplicate positions.\n\nBut this seems to vary between examples, making it hard to find a general rule.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity of the examples, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis for the test input:\n\nThe output for the test input will have each input row placed in segments corresponding to the columns of their duplicates. For rows without duplicates, placed in segments based on row index.\n\nFor row0: duplicates at columns0 and1 \u2192 segments0 and1.\n\nThus, each of the three rows in the section for row0 will have the input row0 in segments0 and1.\n\nBut how to fill the three rows in the section.\n\nIn example1, each section's three rows are the input rows filled in the same segments. For example, the first three rows are input row0 in segments0 and2, input row1 in segments0 and2, input row2 in segments0 and2.\n\nSimilarly, for test input's row0 section (first three rows), each output row would be the corresponding input row filled in segments0 and1.\n\nBut the input rows are three different rows. So the first three output rows would be:\n\nRow0: input row0 in segments0 and1 \u2192 [1,1,7,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: input row1 in segments0 and1 \u2192 [7,4,1,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: input row2 in segments0 and1 \u2192 [5,1,7,5,1,7,0,0,0]\n\nBut example2's first three rows are:\n\n[0,0,0,6,9,9,6,9,9]\n\n[0,0,0,4,6,8,4,6,8]\n\n[0,0,0,9,9,8,9,9,8]\n\nWhich corresponds to input row0 filled in segments1 and2. So each output row in the section is the input row filled in the corresponding segments.\n\nSo perhaps each section's three output rows are the three input rows filled in the same segments.\n\nBut example1's first three output rows are filled in segments0 and2 for all three input rows. So the pattern is that for a given section (corresponding to a particular input row's processing), all three output rows in that section have the same segments filled, but using all three input rows.\n\nBut this contradicts example0's structure, where each section corresponds to a different input row.\n\nAlternatively, the sections are processed such that each section is determined by the input row's own properties, and each section contains three output rows filled with all three input rows according to that row's segment filling rule.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach for the test input:\n\n- Each input row is processed to determine which segments to fill based on duplicate columns.\n\n- For each input row, generate three output rows where the row is filled in the determined segments, but for all three input rows.\n\nFor example, test input row0 has segments0 and1 filled. So the first three output rows would be:\n\n[1,1,7,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,7,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,7,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples. In example0's output, each section's three rows are the three input rows filled in the same segment.\n\nExample0's first three rows are the input rows filled in segment0. So for the test input's row0, which should fill segments0 and1, the first three output rows would be:\n\n[1,1,7,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[7,4,1,7,4,1,0,0,0]\n\n[5,1,7,5,1,7,0,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. However, given the time I've spent and the complexity of the examples, I'll proceed with this approach and generate the output accordingly.",
