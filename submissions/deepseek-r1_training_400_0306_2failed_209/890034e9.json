        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem gives several examples where each input is a list of numbers, and the output is another list that's modified based on some rule. My job is to find that rule and apply it to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first example (Example 0), the input and output lists look almost the same, but there are some changes. Let's compare them. For instance, in the 13th row of the input (index 13?), the input is [1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8], and the output changes some elements to 2. Specifically, positions 9,10,11,12 (0-based maybe?) become 2,2,2,2. Wait, looking at the input row 13 in Example 0, the input has [0,1,0,0] at positions 9-12 (maybe?), and the output replaces them with 2,2,2,2. Oh wait, no, let me check the exact indices.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 13th row (since there are 21 rows each?) is the one with index 13. Let me look at the input for Example 0. The 13th input row is [1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8]. The output for this row is [1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8]. So the elements starting at position 9 (original 0,0,1,1,0, etc.) are replaced with 2,2,2,2. Wait, the input positions 9,10,11,12 were 0,0,1,1, but in the output, they become 2,2,2,2. Hmm. So maybe when certain conditions are met, a group of four consecutive elements is replaced with 2s. But how?\n\nLooking at the other examples. In Example 1, let's check the input row 7. The input is [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3], and the output becomes [0,3,3,3,0,4,4,3,4,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3,0,3,3,3]. So the elements starting at position 11 (0-based) are replaced with 8s. Similarly, in Example 2, some rows have sequences replaced with 4s. \n\nWait, so maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a sequence of four 0s in the input, they are replaced with a sequence of 2s (or another number like 8 or 4) in the output. Alternatively, maybe the replacement depends on the surrounding numbers. Let me check more examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input, looking at row 6: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 8]. The output is the same as input here. Wait, but in the input, there's already a 2,2,2,2. So perhaps the 2s are part of the original input and not part of the transformation. So maybe the transformation is adding 2s where certain conditions are met. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is inserting a block of 2s (or another number) in the middle of the list, possibly replacing existing elements. Let's look for where the input has four consecutive 0s. In Example 0's input row 4: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. The output changes to [1,1,1,1,1,0,2,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0]. Wait, but the output for this row is the same as input. So maybe not replacing 0s. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output row 13: the input had [0,1,0,0] and output becomes [0,2,2,2,2]. Wait, the input positions 9-12 (assuming 0-based) were 0,0,1,1. No, the input row 13 in example 0's input is [1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8]. So positions 8-11 (indices 8,9,10,11) are 0,0,1,1. The output changes these to 2,2,2,2. Wait, maybe when there's a 0,0 followed by 1,1, they're replaced with 2s? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of an 8 in the row triggers the replacement. Looking at Example 0's output row 13, there's an 8 in position 13. Maybe the 8 is a marker, and the replacement happens near it. But how?\n\nIn Example 1, the input row 7's output has a sequence of 8s. The input for that row in Example 1 is [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3]. The output replaces positions 11-15 (0-based) with 8,8,8,8,8. Wait, original elements there were 3,3,3,4,0. So maybe the replacement isn't based on consecutive zeros. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves inserting a block of a certain number (like 2, 8, or 4) in a specific position, perhaps around the middle. For example, in Example 0's output row 13, the replacement is in the middle. Let's check the length of each list. Each list has 21 elements. The middle position would be at index 10 (since 0-20). Let me see: in Example 0's output row 13, the replaced part starts at index 9 (0-based) with 2,2,2,2. Hmm, not exactly the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the presence of certain numbers in the list. For example, if there's an 8, the replacement is done. Or maybe the sum of certain elements triggers it. But this seems vague.\n\nAnother approach: compare each input and output row for all examples to see where they differ. For Example 0:\n\nLooking at the input and output rows, in the first few rows, they are the same. The first change is in row 13 (starting count from 0). Let's compare input and output rows for Example 0:\n\nRow 13 input: [1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8]\nRow 13 output: [1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8]\n\nThe difference is at positions 9-12 (indices 9,10,11,12), where input has 0,0,1,1 and output has 2,2,2,2. So four elements replaced with 2s.\n\nIn Example 1, row 7 input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3]\nOutput row 7: [0,3,3,3,0,4,4,3,4,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3,0,3,3,3]\n\nHere, positions 11-15 (elements 3,3,3,4,0) are replaced with 8,8,8,8,8. That's five elements. Hmm, not four. So maybe different patterns.\n\nIn Example 2's row 14 input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 0]\nOutput row 14: [0,0,2,2,2,3,2,0,0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,2,2,0]\n\nHere, positions 10-15 (3,2,0,3,0,2) are replaced with 4,4,4,4,4,4. So six elements. So the number of replaced elements varies. Hmm. This complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is a sequence of the same number, but the length depends on the example. For instance, in Example 0, the replacement is four 2s, in Example 1, five 8s, and in Example 2, six 4s. But how is this determined?\n\nLooking for a pattern in the replacement numbers: in Example 0, the replacement is 2s; in Example 1, 8s; in Example 2, 4s. What do these numbers have in common? 2, 4, 8 are powers of 2. Maybe the replacement number is determined by the maximum value in the input row. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 13, the input has 8 as the highest value, so replacement is 2s. Wait, no. 8 is present, but they use 2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the number of the example (0,1,2) determines the replacement. Example 0 uses 2s, Example 1 uses 8s, Example 2 uses 4s. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the number of digits in the input. For example, in Example 0's row 13, the 8 is present, so maybe the replacement is 2 (since 8 is 2^3). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the same as the number in the example's index. Example 0 uses 2 (since index 0?), Example 1 uses 8 (index 1?), Example 2 uses 4 (index 2?). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the maximum number in the entire input. Example 0 has 8 as the highest, so replacement is 2? No, that doesn't make sense. Example 1 has 8s in some rows, so replacement is 8. Example 2's maximum is 4, so replacement is 4. That seems possible. So, in each example, the replacement number is the maximum value present in the input lists. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input has 8, so replacement is 2? No, in Example 0's row 13, the output uses 2. But the input has 8. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement number is determined by the position where the replacement occurs. For instance, in Example 0, replacement is 2; in Example 1, 8; in Example 2,4. The test input's test example may have a certain number to use. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is a block of a certain number that's present elsewhere in the row. For example, in Example 0's row 13, there's an 8, and the replacement is 2. But 2 is present in earlier rows. In Example 1, the replacement is 8, which is present in the input. In Example 2, the replacement is 4, which is present in the input. So maybe the replacement number is a specific number that's already in the input, like the maximum or another.\n\nBut how to determine which number to use. For example, in Example 0's row 13, the replacement is 2. In the input row 13, there are 2s in positions 6-9 (elements 2,0,0,2). So maybe when a certain number (like 2) is present, the replacement uses that number. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is a fixed block of four 2s, eight 8s, etc., based on the example. But this doesn't explain why different examples use different numbers.\n\nAnother angle: looking for the position where the replacement occurs. In Example 0's row 13, the replacement starts at index 9. In Example 1's row 7, replacement starts at index 11. In Example 2's row 14, starts at index 10. Not a clear pattern here.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement is triggered by a certain element in the row, like an 8. For example, in Example 0's row 13, there's an 8 at index 13. The replacement is four 2s starting at index 9. Maybe the presence of an 8 in the row requires inserting a block of 2s four positions before the 8. But the distance between the replacement and the 8 is 4 positions (from index 9 to 13). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement occurs at a fixed position relative to the end of the list. Each list has 21 elements. For example, in Example 0's row 13, the replacement starts at index 9, which is position 10 (since 0-based). 21 elements: the middle is at index 10. So replacement starts at index 9, which is just before the middle. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the replacement is done in the middle of the list. For 21 elements, the middle is index 10. Let's check where the replacement starts. In Example 0's row 13: replacement starts at 9, which is just before the middle. In Example 1's row 7, replacement starts at 11, which is after the middle. In Example 2's row 14, starts at 10 (the middle). So maybe the replacement is centered around the middle. For example, inserting four 2s starting at index 8 (so positions 8-11). But this varies.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is inserted in the middle of the list, replacing four elements. For example, 21 elements, middle at 10, so replace elements 8-11 (four elements). But in Example 0's row 13, the replacement starts at 9 and covers four elements (indices 9-12). So that's four elements. In Example 1's row 7, five elements are replaced. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to look for a commonality among the changed elements. Let's take the first example where a change occurs:\n\nExample 0's input row 13:\n\nOriginal elements at positions 9-12: 0,0,1,1 \u2192 replaced by 2,2,2,2.\n\nIn Example 1's row 7:\n\nOriginal elements at positions 11-15: 3,3,3,4,0 \u2192 replaced by 8,8,8,8,8.\n\nIn Example 2's row 14:\n\nOriginal elements at positions 10-15: 3,2,0,3,0,2 \u2192 replaced by 4,4,4,4,4,4.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that a consecutive sequence of elements is replaced by a block of the same number. The length of the block varies (4,5,6 elements). The replacement number also varies (2,8,4). \n\nLooking for what determines the replacement number and the length. The replacement number might be determined by the example (0 uses 2, 1 uses 8, 2 uses 4). The length might be determined by the position where the replacement occurs. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the maximum value in the entire input list. For Example 0, the input has 8, so replacement is 2. No, that doesn't make sense. For Example 1, the input has 8, replacement is 8. For Example 2, the input's maximum is 4, replacement is 4. So maybe the replacement number is the maximum value in the entire input of that example. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input has 8, and the replacement is 2. Doesn't fit. Wait, but maybe the replacement number is the maximum minus 6? 8-6=2. Example 1's replacement is 8, which is the maximum. Example 2's replacement is 4, which is the maximum. So maybe in the first example, the replacement is max -6, but that's inconsistent. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is determined by the row's own maximum. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 13 input: the maximum is 8 (there's an 8 at position 2 and 13). Replacement is 2. Not matching.\n\nIn Example 1's row 7 input: the maximum is 4 and 8? Wait, the input has 0,3,4. But in Example 1's row 7 input, the elements are [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3]. The maximum here is 4. Replacement is 8. So that's higher than the max. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement number is a fixed value per example, regardless of the row. For example, in Example 0, all replacements are 2s. In Example 1, all replacements are 8s. In Example 2, all are 4s. Let's check:\n\nLooking at Example 0's output rows. For instance, row 13's replacement is 2s. Other rows like row 14's input is [1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,8,1,0,0,1,1,8,1,1,8,1,0,1], and output becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,8,2,0,0,2,1,8,1,1,8,1,0,1]. Wait, here the replacement is inserting 2s at positions 9 and 12. Or maybe not. Let me look: input row 14 has elements at positions 9-12: 1,0,0,1. Output changes to 2,0,0,2. So 1\u21922 and 1\u21922. So that's not a block of 2s. So maybe the replacement isn't consistent within an example. This complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is to replace certain sequences with a specific pattern. For instance, in Example 0's row 13, the replacement is 0,0,1,1 \u2192 2,2,2,2. But why? Maybe when there's a 0,0 followed by 1,1, they become 2s. But in Example 1's row 7, the replaced sequence is 3,3,3,4,0 \u2192 8s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is triggered by the presence of a specific number in the row. For example, if there's an 8 in the row, replace some elements with 2s. But in Example 0's row 13, there are 8s, and replacement is 2s. In Example 1's row 7, there's no 8 in the input, but replacement is 8s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to insert a specific block of numbers (like four 2s) in the middle of the list, overwriting existing elements. For example, in a 21-element list, inserting four 2s starting at position 9. But how does that vary across examples?\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is done at a fixed position in each example. For Example 0, replacement starts at position 9, in Example 1 at position 11, etc. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the number of replacements is determined by the example index. Example 0 replaces 4 elements, example 1 replaces 5, example 2 replaces 6. But the test example would then replace 3 elements? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a different angle. \n\nLooking at the test input provided. The test input has several rows. For example, the first row is [0,2,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,1,1,1,0,1,2]. The expected output would follow the same pattern as the training examples. \n\nAssuming that the pattern involves replacing a certain sequence with a block of a specific number. Looking at the test input, perhaps looking for rows that have a sequence that should be replaced. For example, in the test input, row 13 is [1,3,3,3,3,1,2,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1]. Maybe here, the 3,3,3,3 would be replaced with another number. Or perhaps a sequence like 0,0 in positions 13-14 (0,0) would be replaced. But according to the training examples, the replacement numbers vary. For example, Example 0 uses 2, Example 1 uses 8, Example 2 uses 4. So perhaps the test example uses a replacement number based on some rule. \n\nAlternatively, the test input has a '3' in some rows, so maybe the replacement number is 3. But in the training examples, each example had a unique replacement number. So perhaps the replacement number is the maximum number in the row. For example, in the test input's row 13, the maximum is 3, so replacement could be 3. But in Example 0's row 13, the maximum is 8, but replacement was 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is determined by the number in the example. Since the test input is a new example, maybe it uses a replacement number like 2, 8, or 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the test input's rows have some numbers like 3 and 2. Maybe the replacement number is 2. For example, in row 13, there's a sequence of 3,3,3,3. Replacing that with 2,2,2,2. Or perhaps replacing a different sequence.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is to look for a sequence of four consecutive 0s and replace them with 2s. Looking at the test input's rows. For example, row 8: [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0]. Here, there's a sequence of four 0s at positions 12-15. So maybe this would be replaced with four 2s. But according to the training examples, sometimes the replacement is longer. In Example 1's row 7, five 8s. So maybe the replacement is to replace a sequence of four or more zeros with a block of a certain number. But in the test input, row 8 has four 0s. If that's the case, then replace with 2s. But how to determine the number.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is determined by the minimum or maximum of the row. For row 8 in the test input, the max is 2. So replacement could be 2. But in Example 0's row 13, the max is 8 and replacement is 2. So maybe not.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let's try to think of the general pattern across all training examples:\n\nIn each example, certain rows have a block of numbers replaced with a repeating number (2, 8, 4). The number of replaced elements varies (4,5,6). The replacement number also varies per example. The location of the replacement varies. \n\nBut the key is that the output for each example's input is almost the same as the input, except for these blocks. So maybe the pattern is that in each example, one of the rows has a block replaced, and the rest are the same. For example, in Example 0, the first few rows are unchanged, but row 13 has a block replaced. Similarly for other examples. So the transformation is to replace a certain block in one row of the input with a specific pattern. But how to determine which row and what to replace.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros (or another pattern) in any row with a sequence of a certain number. For Example 0, replace four elements with 2s. For Example 1, replace five elements with 8s. For Example 2, replace six elements with 4s. \n\nBut in Example 0's row 13, the input has two zeros followed by two ones. So not four zeros. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is based on the presence of a certain number in the row. For instance, if the row contains an 8, replace a certain part with 2s. But in Example 0's row 13, the row has 8s and replacement is 2s. In Example 1's row 7, no 8s in input but replacement is 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the replacement is to insert a sequence of a certain number in the middle of the row. For example, in the test input, each row has 21 elements. The middle is index 10. So replacing elements around there. For example, in the test input's row 13: [1,3,3,3,3,1,2,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1]. The middle is index 10, which is 1. Maybe replacing the elements around index 10 with 3s. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is to look for sequences that start and end with the same number and replace them with a block of that number. For example, in Example 0's row 13, 0,0,1,1 \u2192 starts with 0 and ends with 1, which are different, so not sure. \n\nAnother idea: in all training examples, the output for each example is the same as the input, except that in some rows, a sequence of numbers is replaced with a block of a specific number. The specific number seems to be linked to the example's index: Example 0 uses 2 (maybe example index 0: 2^1?), Example 1 uses 8 (2^3), Example 2 uses 4 (2^2). So perhaps the replacement number is 2^(example index +1). Example 0: 2^(0+1) =2; Example 1: 2^(1+1)=4, but they used 8. So this doesn't fit. Wait, Example 1's replacement is 8, which is 2^3. Example 2 uses 4=2^2. So maybe the exponent is example index +2. Example 0: 0+2=2 \u2192 2^2=4. But Example 0's replacement is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is double the example index plus 2. Example 0: 0*2+2=2. Example 1:1*2+2=4. Example 2: 2*2+2=6. But Example 1 uses 8. So no.\n\nThis line of thinking isn't leading anywhere. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nIn each example, the output for the test cases seems to have a block of numbers inserted. For instance, in Example 0, the block is 2s; in Example 1, 8s; in Example 2, 4s. The number of elements in the block varies. Maybe the block is inserted in the same position where the original elements meet a certain condition.\n\nAlternatively, the block is inserted after the first occurrence of a certain number. For example, in Example 0's row 13, after the 0s, insert 2s. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the block is inserted in a position that's determined by the presence of a certain number. For example, in Example 0's row 13, the 8 at position 13 triggers the insertion of 2s four positions before it. But how to generalize.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not seeing a clear pattern, perhaps I should consider that the transformation is to replace a certain part of each row with a block of numbers, where the block is determined by the example. For the test input, since the examples used 2,8,4, maybe the test uses another number. But looking at the test input's rows, the numbers present are 0,1,2,3. So possible replacement numbers could be 2 or 3. For example, in the test input's row 13, which has 3,3,3,3, perhaps replace them with 2s or 3s. But according to the training examples, replacement numbers are higher than the existing numbers. In Example 0's row 13, 2 is present. In Example 1's row 7, 8 is higher than existing numbers. So maybe the replacement number is the maximum possible in the input plus one. But in Example 0, the max is 8, replacement is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the sum of the first and last elements of the row. For example, in Example 0's row 13, first element is 1, last is 8. Sum is 9. Not 2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is to replace a sequence of four elements with a sequence of the same number, which is the sum of certain elements. Not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I'll have to make an educated guess based on the training examples. \n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the replacement was inserting 2s. Example 1 used 8s, Example 2 used 4s. So each example used a different number. For the test input, perhaps the replacement number is 3, as it appears in some rows. For example, in row 13 of the test input, there are four 3s. Maybe replacing them with 3s, but that would be the same as the input. Alternatively, replace them with another number like 2 or 4.\n\nAlternatively, in the test input, looking for sequences that match the pattern from the training examples. For example, in the test input's row 8: [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0]. Here, there's a sequence of four 0s at positions 12-15. According to Example 0's row 13, replacing two 0s and two 1s with 2s, maybe here replace four 0s with 2s. So the output for row 8 would have 2,2,2,2 in those positions.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 13, it was two 0s and two 1s replaced with 2s, so it's not exactly four 0s. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, in the test input, the replacement is inserting 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 13 of the test input, which is [1,3,3,3,3,1,2,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1], the four 3s might be replaced with 2s. But the training examples don't show such a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is to insert a block of a certain number in the middle of the row. For the test input, let's assume that each row in the test input should have a block of 2s inserted in the middle. For example, replacing the middle four elements with 2s. \n\nBut how to determine which row to modify. In the training examples, not all rows are modified. For example, in Example 0, the first 13 rows are unchanged, and then row 13 is modified. Wait, no, in Example 0's input and output, the first few rows are the same, and the changes start at row 13. So maybe the transformation is applied to a specific row in each example. But how to determine which row.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Perhaps I should look at the test input and see if there's a row that matches a pattern from the training examples. For instance, the test input's row 13 has four 3s. In Example 2's row 14, there was a sequence of 3,2,0,3,0,2 replaced with 4,4,4,4,4,4. So maybe in the test input, similar sequences would be replaced with 4s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's row 13 has four 3s, and perhaps they are replaced with 3s, but that doesn't change. Or perhaps they're replaced with another number. \n\nGiven the time I've spent without a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the most plausible pattern. The training examples show that each example's output replaces a certain block of elements with a sequence of the same number. The replacement number seems to be specific to each example (Example 0: 2, Example 1:8, Example 2:4). For the test input, perhaps the replacement number is 2, and the replacement is done in the row where a certain condition is met (like the presence of four consecutive 0s). \n\nLooking at the test input's row 8: [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0]. There are four consecutive 0s at positions 12-15. So maybe replace these four 0s with 2s. Therefore, the output for row 8 would be [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,0]. Wait, but the original list has 21 elements. Let me count: positions 0-20. The four 0s are at positions 12,13,14,15. Replacing them with 2,2,2,2. So the output row 8 would be [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,0]. But the original row 8 is [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0]. After replacement, the zeros at positions 12-15 become 2s. \n\nIf this is the case, then the output for row 8 would have 2s there. But how does this fit with the training examples? In Example 0's row 13, there were two 0s and two 1s replaced with 2s. Not exactly four zeros, but maybe the rule is to replace any four consecutive elements with 2s if they meet certain criteria. \n\nAlternatively, the replacement is triggered by four consecutive zeros, which are replaced with 2s. So in the test input's row 8, that's the case. \n\nBut how to determine which rows in the test input should be modified. For example, row 7: [1,1,1,2,2,1,0,1,2,2,1,1,2,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,2]. There are two 2s in a row, but not four. No four zeros. \n\nRow 6: [0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1]. There are three zeros in a row (positions 3-5:0,0,0). Not four. \n\nRow 5: [1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,0]. Here, there's a sequence of two zeros. \n\nRow 8 has four zeros. So perhaps row 8 is the one modified. \n\nBut according to the training examples, the output for each example has multiple rows modified. For example, Example 0's output has several rows changed. But in the test input, perhaps only one row is modified. \n\nAlternatively, the test input's row 13 has four 3s. Maybe replace them with a block of 3s. But that would not change anything. Or replace them with another number. \n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is 2, and any four consecutive same numbers are replaced with 2s. But in Example 0's row 13, that's not the case. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that in the test input, any four consecutive 0s are replaced with 2s. Therefore, in row 8 of the test input, the four 0s at positions 12-15 are replaced with 2,2,2,2. \n\nAdditionally, looking at the test input's row 13: [1,3,3,3,3,1,2,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1]. The four 3s at positions 1-4. Maybe these are replaced with 2s. But in the training examples, replacements didn't target sequences of non-zero numbers. \n\nAlternatively, the replacement is for sequences of the same number other than zero. For example, four 3s replaced with 2s. \n\nBut without clear evidence from the training examples, this is a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the test input's row 13 has four 3s. Following Example 2's pattern, where a sequence was replaced with 4s, perhaps here replace with 2s. \n\nBut I'm not certain. Given the examples, perhaps the safest assumption is to replace four consecutive elements in the middle with 2s, as in Example 0. So for the test input's row 8, replacing four zeros with 2s. \n\nSo, the output for row 8 would be:\n\nOriginal: [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0]\n\nOutput: [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,0]\n\nBut the original row has 21 elements, so after replacement, it should still have 21. The four zeros at positions 12-15 become 2s. So the output would be:\n\n[1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,0] \u2192 but wait, original has 21 elements. The replacement would be:\n\nPositions 12-15 (indices 12,13,14,15): 0,0,0,0 \u2192 replaced with 2,2,2,2. So the output row 8 is:\n\n[1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,0]\n\nWait, but the original list is:\n\n[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nAfter replacement, indices 12-15 are 2s:\n\n[1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,0]\n\nBut this has 22 elements. Oh no, wait, the original list has 21 elements. Let me recount:\n\nIndices 0-20:\n\n0:1, 1:0, 2:1, 3:0, 4:1, 5:0, 6:0, 7:2, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, 11:0, 12:0, 13:0, 14:0, 15:1, 16:1, 17:1, 18:0, 19:1, 20:0.\n\nReplacing indices 12-15 (0,0,0,0) with 2,2,2,2:\n\nNew list would be:\n\n[1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,0]\n\nWait, no. Indices 12-15 are four elements. Replacing them with four 2s:\n\nAfter replacement, the list would be:\n\n[1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,0] \u2192 which is 21 elements. So index 12-15 replaced.\n\nBut the original list's indices 12-15 are zeros. So this replacement makes sense.\n\nAssuming this is the only change in the test input, then the output for row 8 would have the four zeros replaced with 2s. But other rows may also have changes. For example, row 13's four 3s might be replaced with 2s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the pattern is to replace four consecutive elements with 2s in the middle of the row, then for each row in the test input, the middle four elements (indices 9-12) would be replaced with 2s. Let's check:\n\nFor the first test input row: [0,2,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,1,1,1,0,1,2]. The middle four elements are indices 9-12: 0,0,1,0. Replacing with 2s would give: 0,2,2,2,2,0. So the row becomes [0,2,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0,1,2]. But this may not align with the training examples.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to apply the pattern observed in the training examples: replacing a sequence of elements with a block of 2s, similar to Example 0. For the test input's row 8, replacing four consecutive zeros with 2s. Therefore, the final output would be the same as the test input, except for row 8, which has the four zeros replaced with 2s.\n\nThus, the test output would be the same as the test input, but with the appropriate rows modified.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples provided. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first example (Example 0), the input and output lists are quite similar. But there are some differences. Let me compare them line by line. \n\nFor instance, in the input's 13th list (index 13), the input is:\n[1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8]\nAnd the output is:\n[1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8]\nSo here, starting at position 9, the original elements [0, 0, 1, 1] become [2,2,2,2]. Wait, no. Wait the input has [0,1,0,0] at positions 8-11 (assuming 0-based index). Wait, maybe not. Let me check again. The input list is [1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8]. The output for this list changes elements starting at index 9 (element 0) to 2,2,2,2. Wait, the output list has [0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, ...]. Wait, maybe looking at the exact positions:\n\nOriginal elements at positions 9,10,11,12 in input: 0, 0, 1, 1. In the output, they become 2,2,2,2. So those four elements are replaced with 2s. Also, in the next example, Example 1, let's look for a similar pattern. \n\nIn Example 1, looking at the input's 7th list (index 7), the input is:\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3]\nOutput becomes:\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3]\nHere, positions 11-15 (0-based) in the input were 3,3,3,4,0. In the output, they are replaced with 8,8,8,8,8. So four elements replaced by 8s. Wait, but in the previous example, four 2s replaced four elements. Hmm. \n\nAnother example in Example 0, let's check another line. The 13th input line in Example 0 (input index 13) had elements [0,0,1,1] replaced with [2,2,2,2]. So maybe when there's a sequence of certain numbers, they are replaced with a block of a specific number. But how to determine which number to replace with?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. For example, in the 14th line (0-based index 14) of the input, the original elements around position 10 are [3,2,0,3,0,2,2]. In the output, they become [4,4,4,4,4,4]. So a block of 4s. Wait, the input here in Example 2's line 14 (input) is:\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 0]\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 2, 3, 2, 2, 0]\n\nSo starting at position 10, the elements 3,2,0,3,0,2 become 4,4,4,4,4,4. Wait, but that's six elements. So perhaps the replacement is of a certain pattern. Wait, maybe the presence of a specific number in the list triggers a replacement of a certain length with a particular digit. But what's the trigger?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern involves replacing a sequence of 0s and other numbers with a block of a specific number. But how?\n\nWait, looking back at Example 0, in the 13th line input, the elements at positions 9-12 (0-based) were [0,0,1,1]. In the output, they became [2,2,2,2]. Similarly, in Example 1, the 7th line input had positions 11-15 (elements 3,3,3,4,0) replaced with 8s. But that's five elements. Wait, no, in Example 1's 7th line, the input's elements at positions 11-15 are 3,3,3,4,0. The output replaces them with 8,8,8,8,8. So that's five 8s. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that whenever there's a 8 in the input, or a certain number, it triggers a replacement. But looking at Example 0, in the 13th line, the input doesn't have an 8 in the replaced area. Wait, the input list before replacement is:\n\n[1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8]\n\nWait, the 8s are at position 2 and 13. The replacement is at positions 9-12 (0-based). So maybe the presence of a certain number elsewhere in the list determines the replacement. Alternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the position in the list. But that seems less likely.\n\nAnother approach: look at the numbers that are in the replaced blocks. In Example 0, the replaced elements are replaced with 2s. In Example 1, replaced with 8s. In Example 2, replaced with 4s. So maybe the replacement number is related to the other elements in the list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is of a specific sequence of numbers. For example, in Example 0, the replacement occurs when there's a 0 followed by 0, then 1, 1. But replaced with four 2s. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's check the numbers before the replaced sections. For Example 0's 13th line, the elements before the replacement (positions 8-11) are 0,0,1,1. Replaced with 2,2,2,2. Maybe the sum or some operation on these numbers leads to 2. But 0+0+1+1=2. Hmm, possible. But let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's 7th line, the replaced elements are 3,3,3,4,0. Sum is 3+3+3+4+0=13. But the replacement is 8. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the number of elements in the sequence. Example 0's replaced four elements, replaced with four 2s. Example 1's replaced five elements with five 8s. Example 2's replaced six elements with six 4s. But how to determine which number to use?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the position of the list within the larger structure. For example, in Example 0, the 13th line (maybe middle of the list), but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is triggered by a certain number in the list. For example, in Example 0, there are 8s present. The replacement uses 2. In Example 1, there's a 8 in the input (like line 10, which has [3,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,0,3,3,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4], but the output for line 10 is replacing the 8s with more 8s. Wait, but in Example 1's line 7, the replacement is 8s. Maybe the presence of 8 in the input indicates that the replacement should be 8. But in Example 0's line 13, there's 8 in the list, but the replacement is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number is determined by the maximum value in the list. For Example 0's line 13, the maximum is 8. Replacement is 2. No, that doesn't make sense. For Example 1's line 7, max is 4 (before replacement), but replacement is 8. So that's higher than the max. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 1's line 7 input, after replacement, the 8s are introduced. So maybe the replacement is to insert a block of 8s. Similarly, in Example 0, the replacement is a block of 2s, and Example 2 uses 4s. So perhaps the replacement number is one higher than the maximum number in the original list. Wait, let's see:\n\nExample 0's line 13 input: elements being replaced are 0,0,1,1. Max is 1. Replacement is 2. So 1+1=2. Example 1's line 7: elements replaced are 3,3,3,4,0. Max is 4. Replacement is 8. Wait, 4*2=8. Or maybe 4+4=8. Not sure. Example 2's line 14: elements replaced are 3,2,0,3,0,2. Max is 3. Replacement is 4. So 3+1=4. That fits. So perhaps the replacement number is max +1. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's line 13: max in replaced elements is 1 \u2192 1+1=2. Yes. Example 1's line 7: max is 4 \u2192 4+4=8? Or 4*2=8. Hmm, but 4+1 would be 5. So maybe not. Wait, 4 in example 1's line 7's replaced elements is the max. If the replacement is 8, that's 4*2. Or maybe the replacement number is 8 regardless. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number is determined by the number of elements being replaced. For Example 0's line 13: 4 elements replaced with 2. 4/2=2. Example 1's line 7: 5 elements replaced with 8. 5*1.6=8? Not sure. Example 2's line 14: 6 elements replaced with 4. 6*0.666=4. Doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is the same as the length of the replaced block. But in Example 0's line 13, replaced 4 elements with 2. 4/2=2. Example 1's line 7, 5 elements replaced with 8. 5+3=8. Not sure.\n\nHmm. Another angle: looking at the position where the replacement occurs. Maybe the replacement is in the middle of the list. Let's check the indices.\n\nIn Example 0's line 13, the replacement starts at position 9 (0-based) of the list. The list length is 21 elements. So positions 9-12 (4 elements). The replacement is four 2s. \n\nIn Example 1's line 7, replacement starts at position 11 (elements 11-15, 5 elements), replaced with five 8s.\n\nIn Example 2's line 14, replacement starts at position 10 (elements 10-15?), replaced with six 4s. Wait, the output line in Example 2's 14th list is:\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 2, 3, 2, 2, 0]\n\nSo positions 10-15 (inclusive) are six elements replaced with 4s. Original input elements here were 3,2,0,3,0,2. So replaced six elements.\n\nSo in Example 0: 4 elements \u2192 2s.\n\nExample 1: 5 elements \u2192 8s.\n\nExample 2: 6 elements \u21924s.\n\nNot sure. Maybe the replacement is inserting a sequence of a specific number, and the number depends on the example. Like in Example 0, the replacement is 2s, Example 1 8s, Example 2 4s. But why?\n\nLooking back at the examples, each example's output introduces a new number. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 2s appear in the replaced sections, but the input may have 2s elsewhere. Similarly, in Example 1, 8s are introduced. Example 2 uses 4s. So maybe the replacement number is specific to each example. Like, in each example, all replacements use the same number. For Example 0, it's 2; Example 1, 8; Example 2,4. Then the test input would use a new number, perhaps based on the elements present.\n\nBut how to determine which number to use for the test input? Let's look at the test input. The test input lists have numbers like 0,1,2,3. For example, the last list has [1,1,1,2,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1]. So numbers 0,1,2. But there's also a 3 in some lists, like in the 13th list of the test input:\n\n[1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nSo maybe the replacement number is the highest number present in the input lists. For Example 0, the highest number is 8 (since there are 8s in the input), but the replacement uses 2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Or maybe the replacement number is the maximum of the current list. For example, in Example 0's line 13, the list has 8s elsewhere, but the replaced elements are 0,0,1,1. The replacement is 2, which is higher than the max of those elements. But why 2? Maybe because 2 is the next available number in the example. But Example 0's input already has 0,1,8, so perhaps the replacement is using 2, which isn't present in the input. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is the sum of the positions where the replacement starts. For example, in Example 0's line 13, replacement starts at position 9. 9 is the index. Sum not sure. 9+1=10, but 2 is the replacement number. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: in all training examples, the output lists are almost the same as the input lists except for a specific segment that is replaced with a sequence of the same number. The replaced segment's length and the replacement number vary between examples. So the pattern is to replace a certain segment of each list with a block of a specific number. The question is: how to determine which segment to replace and what number to use.\n\nLooking at all three examples:\n\nExample 0: In each output list, a segment is replaced with 2s (four 2s), 8s (five 8s), 4s (six 4s). Wait, no. Wait in Example 0's first example, the input and output are the same except for some lists. For example, in the 13th input list, the output changes some elements to 2s. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 0:\n\nThe input lists and output lists are mostly the same, but some of them have a segment replaced with a series of 2s, 8s, or others. For example, in the input list 13 (index 13), the input has [1,1,8,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,8,1,0,1,0,1,1,8], and the output changes the elements starting at position 9 (0-based) from [0,0,1,1] to [2,2,2,2].\n\nIn Example 1, the 7th input list's output replaces a segment with 8s. The 10th input list's output replaces a segment with 8s again. So perhaps the replacement number is consistent within each example. For Example 0, replacement with 2s; Example 1 with 8s; Example 2 with 4s.\n\nIf that's the case, then for the test input, the replacement number might be determined by the maximum number present in the test input lists. Looking at the test input, the numbers present are 0,1,2,3. The highest is 3. So maybe the replacement number is 4 (3+1), similar to Example 2 where 3 was present and replaced with 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is the maximum number in the entire example. For instance, in Example 0, the maximum number in the input lists is 8, but the replacement uses 2. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is determined by the number of test examples. But the test input is a single example, so that's not helpful.\n\nWait, looking back at the training examples, perhaps each example has a certain replacement number. Example 0 uses 2 and 8. Wait, but in Example 0's output, some lists have 2s added, others have 8s. For example, the first list in Example 0's output is the same as the input. The third list has a 2, which might be part of the input. So perhaps the replacement number is based on the position within the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace sequences of 0s and 1s (as in Example 0) with 2s. But in Example 0's line 13, the original elements are 0,0,1,1 \u2192 replaced with 2s. In Example 1, the replacement is with 8s where the original elements are 3,3,3,4,0. So perhaps it's not about the numbers in the sequence but something else.\n\nAnother observation: in each example, the replacement seems to be a block of four or more consecutive numbers. For example, in Example 0, four 2s. In Example 1, five 8s. In Example 2, six 4s. Maybe the replacement number is determined by the example's order: first example uses 2, second 8, third 4. But that's arbitrary. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number is derived from the length of the replaced block. For example, four elements replaced \u2192 2 (since 4/2=2), five \u2192 8 (but 5 doesn't relate to 8), six \u21924. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is the sum of the elements being replaced. For Example 0's line 13, sum is 0+0+1+1=2 \u2192 replacement number 2. For Example 1's line 7, sum is 3+3+3+4+0=13 \u2192 13 modulo something? Not sure. But replacement is 8. 13 modulo 5 is 3, but that's not 8. Hmm. For Example 2's line 14, sum is 3+2+0+3+0+2=10 \u2192 replacement is 4. 10/2.5=4. Maybe. But not sure.\n\nThis approach seems possible. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's line 13 sum: 0+0+1+1=2 \u2192 replacement 2. Correct.\n\nExample 1's line 7 sum: 3+3+3+4+0=13 \u2192 13 \u2192 but replacement is 8. Hmm. Doesn't match. \n\nExample 2's line 14 sum:3+2+0+3+0+2=10 \u2192 replacement is 4. 10/2.5=4. But why 2.5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average of the elements. Example 0's line 13 average is 0.5 \u2192 rounded to 2? Not sure. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of elements in the replaced block. For Example 0's 4 elements \u2192 2 (4/2=2). Example 1's 5 elements \u2192 8 (but 5*1.6=8). Example 2's 6 elements \u21924 (6*0.666=4). Not sure.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the positions where the replacement occurs. For Example 0's line 13, the replacement starts at index 9. The length of the list is 21 elements. Maybe the middle part is being replaced. In 21 elements, the middle is position 10. So replacement starts at 9, which is near the middle. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each list has a certain 'run' of elements that need to be replaced. For example, in Example 0's line 13, the elements 0,0,1,1 are replaced with 2,2,2,2. Maybe any sequence of two or more zeros followed by ones gets replaced with 2s. But in Example 1's line 7, the sequence is 3,3,3,4,0, which gets replaced with 8s. That doesn't fit the previous pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the presence of a specific number elsewhere in the list. For example, in Example 0's line 13, there's an 8 in the list, and the replacement is 2. 8/4=2. Maybe. In Example 1's line 7, there's a 4 in the list, and replacement is 8 (4*2=8). In Example 2's line 14, there's a 3 in the list, and replacement is 4 (3+1=4). So perhaps the replacement number is double the maximum value present in the list. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's line 13: max is 8. 8/4=2. Not sure. Or max is 8, replacement is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's line 7: max in the input list is 4. 4*2=8. That fits.\n\nExample 2's line 14: max in the list is 3. 3+1=4. That fits.\n\nSo maybe the replacement number is max +1 if the example is 2, and max *2 for example 1. Wait, that's inconsistent. But maybe the replacement number is the maximum value in the example's input plus 1. For Example 0, the input has 8 as the maximum. 8+1=9. But replacement is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the maximum value found in the entire example. For example, in Example 0, the input has 8 as the maximum, but the replacement uses 2. That doesn't align. Example 1's input has 8 as well (in the 10th list), and replacement uses 8. Example 2's input max is 4 (from the fourth list), and replacement uses 4. So maybe the replacement number is the maximum value in the example. Example 0's replacement uses 2, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, there are 8s. So why replacement is 2? That's confusing. Maybe the replacement number is the second highest number in the example. In Example 0, numbers are 0,1,2,8. So second highest is 2. That fits. Example 1's numbers include 0,3,4,8. Second highest is 4. But replacement in Example 1's line 7 is 8. Doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the number that appears the least in the example. For Example 0, 2 appears in some lists, but in the input, maybe 2 is rare. But in the output, they add 2s. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let's try to look for another approach. Perhaps the replacement is inserting a block of a certain number that's already present in the input, but in a specific way. For example, in Example 0's line 13, the input has 8s, but the replacement is 2s. Maybe 2 is the number of 8s in the list. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's line 13 input, there are three 8s (positions 2, 13, and 20). So three 8s. Replacement number is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the replacement is triggered by a specific sequence of numbers. For example, in Example 0's line 13, the sequence 0,0,1,1 is replaced with 2,2,2,2. Maybe any sequence of two 0s followed by two 1s is replaced with four 2s. Similarly, in Example 1's line 7, the sequence 3,3,3,4,0 is replaced with 8s. But what triggers that? It's hard to find a common trigger here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done in the middle of the list. For example, in each list, a certain middle section is replaced. For a list of 21 elements, the middle positions are around 10. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's line 13 replacement starts at position 9 (elements 9-12).\n\nExample 1's line 7 replacement starts at position 11 (elements 11-15).\n\nExample 2's line 14 replacement starts at position 10 (elements 10-15).\n\nSo varying positions, but all in the middle region. Maybe the replacement starts at a certain index and extends for a certain number of elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to a segment that contains a certain number of elements, and the replacement number is based on the example's index. For example, Example 0 (index 0) uses 2, Example 1 (index 1) uses 8, Example 2 (index 2) uses 4. Then the test input would use the next number, like 6, but that's speculative.\n\nBut how to apply this to the test input? The test input is a separate example, so perhaps the replacement number is based on the numbers present in the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input, the highest number present is 3. So maybe the replacement number is 4 (3+1). Then, in the test input lists, wherever the pattern occurs, they are replaced with 4s.\n\nNow, looking for which list in the test input has a segment that needs to be replaced. Let's look at the test input lists:\n\nFor example, let's look at the 13th list of the test input:\n\nINPUT:\n[1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nIf the pattern is to replace a segment with four or more elements with the replacement number (which would be 4 for this test case), then perhaps in this list, the elements [0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, ...] need to be replaced. But where?\n\nAlternatively, look for sequences in the test input that resemble the training examples. For example, in the test input's list 14:\n\n[2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nMaybe the elements from positions 10-15 are [0,1,1,1,1,1]. If the pattern is to replace a sequence of 1s, but in the training examples, replacements were not of 1s. So perhaps not.\n\nLooking at the test input's list 15:\n\n[1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nPerhaps a sequence here. Or list 16:\n\n[1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nLooking for sequences of numbers that could be replaced. For example, in list 13 of the test input, after the 3s, there's a 2, 0, 2, then 1,1,0,1,0,0,1,... Maybe the segment starting at position 9: [1,1,0,1,0,0,1]. If the replacement number is 4, and the length is 4 elements, then replace four elements with 4s.\n\nBut this is just guesswork. Alternatively, perhaps the test input's lists that have 3s in them (like list 13-18) are the ones that will have replacements. For example, list 13 has four 3s at the beginning. Maybe the replacement is in that area. But in the training examples, replacements were not necessarily near the start.\n\nAnother idea: the replacement is done in the same position in each list. For example, in Example 0, the 13th line's replacement starts at position 9. In Example 1, the 7th line's replacement starts at position 11. But this varies per example. So position is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is done after a certain element. For example, after the occurrence of a specific number. In Example 0's line 13, after an 8. But the 8 is at position 2, and the replacement is at position 9. Not sure.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Maybe I should look for the number of changed elements in each example.\n\nIn Example 0's line 13, four elements are changed to 2s.\n\nIn Example 1's line 7, five elements are changed to 8s.\n\nIn Example 2's line 14, six elements are changed to 4s.\n\nThe number of elements replaced seems to increase by one each example. Example 0:4, Example1:5, Example2:6. If so, the test example would replace seven elements with a new number. But what number?\n\nAlternatively, the number of replaced elements is the example's index plus four. Example0 (index0) has 4 elements, example1 (index1) 5, example2 (index2) 6. Then test example would have 7 elements replaced. But what number?\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number increases by 2 each example: 2, 8, 4. Not a clear pattern. Maybe the replacement number is 2 for example0, 8 for example1, 4 for example2. The test example could use 6, but there's no clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the highest number in the input plus 1. For example:\n\nExample0's input has 8, so 8+1=9. But replacement is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's input has 8, so 8+1=9. But replacement is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's input has 4, so 4+1=5. But replacement is 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the sum of the digits in the example. Example0's first example: sum of all numbers? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the test input's lists. The 13th list in the test input has [1,3,3,3,3,1,2,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1]. If the pattern is to replace a sequence of zeros and ones with 4s (since the highest number in the test input is 3, replacement number would be 4), then maybe replacing the sequence [0,1,0,0,1,0,0] with 4s. But where?\n\nAlternatively, look for a sequence in the test input that matches the patterns from the training examples. For instance, in Example0's line13, the replacement was of a sequence containing 0s and 1s. In the test input, perhaps a similar sequence exists. For example, in the test input's list 13, positions 10-13 are [1,0,1,0,0]. Maybe replaced with 4s.\n\nBut how to determine the exact segment? This is quite tricky without a clear pattern.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output of each training example to see what changes. For example, in Example0's output, the only changes are in certain lists where a block of elements is replaced with 2s. Similarly for Example1 with 8s. So perhaps the pattern is: in each example, identify the block of elements that needs to be replaced and replace them with the same number. The number depends on the example. For the test input, we need to find which number to use and which block to replace.\n\nBut how to determine that? The test input's lists contain numbers up to 3. The highest is 3, so perhaps the replacement number is 4. Let's assume that.\n\nNow, identify which list in the test input has a segment that would be replaced with 4s. Looking for a sequence that matches the pattern from the training examples. For example, a sequence of mixed numbers that gets replaced with a single number.\n\nLooking at the test input's 15th list:\n\n[1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nPerhaps the segment from position 8-13: [0,1,1,1,0,2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 17th list:\n\n[1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nLooking for a sequence of 0s and 1s. Maybe the segment [0,0,3,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 14th list in the test input:\n\n[2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nPositions 10-15: [0,1,1,1,1,1]. If the replacement number is 4, maybe replace these five 1s with 4s. But in the training examples, the replaced segments weren't uniform numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the 13th list has [1,3,3,3,3,1,2,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1]. Maybe the segment starting after the four 3s. For example, positions 5-8: [1,2,0,2]. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I have, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the previous examples. \n\nIn each training example, the output replaced a certain segment in some of the lists with a block of a specific number (2, 8, 4). For the test input, since the highest number present is 3, perhaps the replacement number is 4. \n\nLooking at the test input's lists, the 15th list is:\n\n[1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nMaybe the segment starting at position 8-11: [0,1,1,1] is replaced with [4,4,4,4]. \n\nOr in the 14th list:\n\n[2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nThe segment from position 10-15: [0,1,0,1,1,1] could be replaced with six 4s.\n\nAlternatively, the 16th list:\n\n[1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nHere, positions 7-10 are [0,0,0,1]. Maybe replaced with four 4s.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is guesswork. \n\nAlternatively, the test input's 13th list has a sequence of four 3s. Perhaps replacing that with four 4s. But the input is [1,3,3,3,3,1,2,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1], so the four 3s are at positions 1-4. The output would replace them with 4s. But in the training examples, the replacement was not of the same number. For example, in Example0's line 13, the replacement was of 0,0,1,1 with 2s. So perhaps the four 3s here would be replaced with 4s. \n\nBut in the training examples, the replacement number wasn't higher than the current max. For example, Example0's input had 8s, but replaced with 2s. So that's lower. So maybe not.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to assume that in the test input, the replacement number is 4, and the segment to replace is a block of elements in the middle of the list, similar to the training examples. For example, in the 14th list of the test input, replace a segment with 4s. So the output for that list would have a block of 4s inserted. \n\nBut to match the format of the training examples, I'll need to determine which lists in the test input have such a segment. For example, the test input's list 13:\n\nInput: [1,3,3,3,3,1,2,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1]\n\nPerhaps the elements starting at position 9: [1,1,0,1,0,0,1...] are replaced with 4s. But how many elements? In Example0's line13, four elements were replaced. In the test input, perhaps replace four elements starting at position 9: [1,1,0,1] \u2192 [4,4,4,4]. The output list would then be:\n\n[1,3,3,3,3,1,2,0,2,4,4,4,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1]\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the 18th list of the test input:\n\n[1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nPerhaps the sequence of 1s is replaced with 4s. But without knowing the exact pattern, this is uncertain.\n\nGiven that the user expects the response to follow the format of the training examples, and given the time constraints, I'll proceed to hypothesize that in each example, the replacement number is the maximum number in the example plus 1. For the test input, the maximum number is 3, so replacement number is 4. \n\nThen, for each list in the test input, look for a sequence of elements that would be replaced with 4s. For instance, in the lists where there's a sequence of mixed numbers (like zeros and ones) in the middle, replace them with a block of 4s.\n\nThe test input has 21 lists, and based on the training examples, not all lists are modified. Only some have the replacement. So I'll need to identify which lists in the test input require replacement and modify them accordingly.\n\nFor example, let's look at the test input's list 14:\n\n[2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nPossibly replacing the elements from position 10-15 (0,1,1,1,1,1) with six 4s. So the output would be:\n\n[2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nSimilarly, other lists may have similar replacements. \n\nSince this is a puzzle competition, the answer likely requires applying this pattern to the test input by replacing certain segments with 4s. Therefore, the final answer would be the test input lists with some segments replaced by 4s, similar to how the training examples replaced segments with 2s, 8s, or 4s.",
