        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. The training examples have inputs which are lists of numbers, and outputs are lists of three numbers, each repeated three times. Hmm. Let me look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has four lists. The output has three lists. So maybe each output list corresponds to a pair of input lists? Like comparing each consecutive pair? Let's check the input lists:\n\nFirst input list: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\nSecond: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\nThird: same as second?\nFourth: same as first.\n\nThe output is [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. Wait, three outputs for four input lists. Maybe each output is comparing two adjacent input lists. So the first output is between the first and second list, the second between the second and third, third between third and fourth. Then the outputs are three elements. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nWhat's the difference between the first and second list in Example 0. Let's compare the elements:\n\nFirst list: 5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5\nSecond list:5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0\n\nLooking at positions where they differ. Let's index them starting from 0:\n\nPosition 6: 5 vs 0\nPosition 7:5 vs0\nPosition 8:5 vs5 (same)\nPosition9:0 vs0 (same)\nPosition10:5 vs0\nPosition11:5 vs5 (same)\nPosition12:5 vs5 (same)\nPosition13:5 vs0\n\nSo the differing positions are 6,7,10,13. That's four positions. How does that relate to the output [2,2,2]? Not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe the number of 0s added or something. Let's see, the first list has two 0s (positions 4 and 9). The second list has more 0s: positions 4,6,7,9,10,13. So the second list has more 0s. But how does that translate to 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output number is derived from the number of times a certain pattern changes between consecutive lists. Like, maybe looking at runs of 5s and 0s. For example, the first list is a series of 5s with 0s at positions 4 and 9. The second list has 0s inserted in other positions. Maybe each output element is counting the number of segments of 5s that are broken into smaller segments when transitioning from one list to the next.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outputs are related to the positions where the 0s are introduced. Let's look at the positions where the second list differs from the first. Positions 6,7,10,13. If we take those positions and do something with their indices. For example, adding them: 6+7+10+13=36. But 36 divided by 18 (since 14 elements per list?), maybe not. Alternatively, maybe each position is converted to binary or something. Wait, 6 is 0110, 7 is 0111, 10 is 1010, 13 is 1101. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the count of 0s introduced in each \"block\" or segment. Let's split the list into segments separated by 0s. The first list is split into [5,5,5,5], [5,5,5,5], [5,5,5,5]. The second list has [5,5,5,5], [5], [0,0,5], [0,0,5,5,0]. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, when comparing the first and second list, the 0s are introduced in positions 6,7,10,13. So maybe each of these new 0s breaks a segment. The original first list's segments between 0s are three blocks of four 5s. The second list's first block (before first 0) is same. Then after first 0 (position4), the next part in first list is 5,5,5,5,0... But in the second list, after position4, it's 5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0. So the segment between position4 and the next 0 (position9) is split into smaller segments. Let me count: between position4 and 9 in the first list, it's 5,5,5,5,5 (positions5-9?), no, the original list is [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,...]. So after the 0 at position4, the next 0 is at position9. So in the first list, from position5 to 8 (inclusive) are 5,5,5,5. In the second list, positions5 is 5, then positions6-7 are 0,0. Then position8 is 5, and position9 is 0. So in the second list, between position4 and 9, the segment is broken into 5 (position5), then two 0s (6-7), then 5 (position8), then 0 (position9). So the original four 5s are split into two parts: a single 5, then a 5 again but with 0s in between. Not sure how that relates to the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the sum of the positions where changes occur. But in Example0, the first output is [2,2,2]. Hmm. 2+2+2=6. The number of changes is 4 (positions6,7,10,13). Doesn't add up. Maybe it's the count of changes in each third of the list? The list is 14 elements long. Divided into thirds, perhaps. 14 divided by 3 is about 4.66. Maybe not. Alternatively, the number of transitions from 5 to 0 or 0 to 5 between consecutive lists. Let's count how many times the value changes between the first and second list. Let's compare each element:\n\nAt each position, if the first list has 5 and the second has 0, that's a change. Positions where they differ are 6,7,10,13. So four changes. But output is three numbers. So maybe each output corresponds to a group of changes. Maybe the list is divided into three parts, and the number of changes in each part is the output number. Let's see: 14 elements divided into three parts. First part: 0-4 (5 elements), second 5-9 (5 elements), third 10-13 (4 elements). In Example0 first to second list, changes are at 6,7,10,13. So in part2 (5-9), positions6 and7: two changes. Part3 (10-13): positions10 and13: two changes. But the first output is [2,2,2]. Wait, but that would be two in the second part and two in the third. Hmm. Doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is the number of transitions in each of the three segments between 0s. For example, the original list has 0s at positions4 and9. So segments are positions0-4 (but ending with 0), then 5-9, then 10-13. But the changes are in positions6,7,10,13. So in segment 5-9, there are two changes (positions6,7). In segment10-13, two changes (10,13). So maybe each of those counts as 2, but why the output is three numbers? Or maybe each output is a count of the number of 0s added in each segment.\n\nWait, in Example0, the first list has 0s at positions4 and9. The second list has 0s at 4,6,7,9,10,13. So the added 0s are at 6,7,10,13. These are in the segments between 5-9 (positions6,7) and 10-13 (positions10,13). So two 0s added in each of those segments, leading to [2,2] but the output has three elements. Maybe the three elements correspond to the three original segments (before first 0, between 0s, after second 0). But in the first list, the segments are:\n\n0-4: [5,5,5,5,0] (but the 0 is at the end)\n5-9: [5,5,5,5,0]\n10-13: [5,5,5,5]\n\nSo when adding 0s in the second list, the added 0s are in the second and third segments. So in the second segment (positions5-9), added two 0s (6,7). In the third segment (positions10-13), added two 0s (10,13). So that would be two and two, but the output is [2,2,2]. Hmm. Maybe each output element is the number of 0s added in each segment. But the first segment (positions0-4) didn't have any added 0s. So first output element is 0, but the output is [2,2,2]. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are related to the number of transitions in each third of the list. Let's split the 14 elements into three parts: first 5 elements (0-4), next 5 (5-9), next 4 (10-13). In the first part (0-4), the first list and second list are the same. So no changes. Second part (5-9): positions5 is 5 in both. Positions6,7: changed to 0. Position8:5 in first, 5 in second. Position9:0 in both. So two changes here. Third part (10-13): position10:5->0. Position11:5->5. 12:5->5. 13:5->0. So two changes here. So the counts would be 0, 2, 2. But the output is [2,2,2]. Hmm. Doesn't fit. Maybe it's the sum of the digits of the positions where the changes occur? For example, in Example0, changes are at 6 (6),7 (7),10 (1+0=1),13 (1+3=4). Summing each group. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output number is the count of 0s in each of the three rows after processing. Wait, but the outputs are three lists, each with three numbers. Wait the output in Example0 has three lists: [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. So three outputs for four input lists. Maybe each output list corresponds to a pair of input lists, as earlier thought. So for four input lists, there are three pairs. Each pair produces an output list. Then each output list's elements (three numbers) correspond to some features in the comparison of the two input lists.\n\nBut in Example0, the three outputs are [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. So each output list has three numbers. Let me think: perhaps each number in the output list corresponds to a specific part of the input lists. Like, splitting each list into three parts (maybe the segments between 0s). For example, each input list is split into three parts by the 0s. Let's take the first input list in Example0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. So splitting on 0s, we have three parts: the first part before the first 0 (positions0-4: 5,5,5,5,0?), no, wait, the 0 is at position4. So the first segment is [5,5,5,5], then the second segment is [5,5,5,5], then the third segment is [5,5,5,5]. So three segments of four 5s each. Then, when comparing to the next list (second input list), the segments are split into smaller parts. For example, the second input list is [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]. Splitting on 0s, the segments would be: first [5,5,5,5], then [5], then [0,0,5], then [0,0,5,5]. Wait, but the original had three segments. So maybe the output is counting how many segments each original segment was split into. For example, the first segment in the first list (four 5s) is still a single segment in the second list. The second segment (four 5s) in the first list is split into three parts in the second list: [5], [0,0,5], [0,0,5,5]. Wait, but maybe I'm splitting on the 0s. Let me split the second input list properly:\n\nSplit on 0s:\n\nPositions0-4: [5,5,5,5,0] \u2192 the first segment is [5,5,5,5]\nThen, from position5 onwards: 5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0. Splitting on 0s:\n\nAfter position4 (0), next element is 5 (position5). Then 0 at position6. So segment from 5 to5: [5] (position5), then 0. Then from position7 to next 0 (position9): [0,5] (positions7-8), then 0 at9. Then from position10:0,5,5,0. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, when comparing two consecutive lists, for each of the original segments (three in the first list), check how many times a 0 is introduced. For example, in Example0, the first segment (positions0-4) is unchanged. The second segment (positions5-9) in the first list is four 5s. In the second list, positions5-9 are 5,0,0,5,0. So between 5-9, there are two 0s introduced. But how does that relate to the output? The output for the first pair is [2,2,2]. Maybe each number in the output represents the number of 0s added in each original segment. Wait, the first segment (0-4) had no added 0s. Second segment (5-9) added two 0s (positions6,7). Third segment (10-13) added two 0s (10,13). So 0,2,2. But the output is [2,2,2]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output numbers are the count of 5s in each segment after the transformation. Wait, in the first input list's segments, each has four 5s. The second list's segments: first segment four 5s, second segment (positions5-9) has one 5 (position5), then another 5 (position8), so total two. Third segment (positions10-13) has 0,5,5,0. So two 5s. So counts are 4, 2, 2. But the output is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are derived from the positions where 0s are introduced. For example, in Example0, the new 0s are at positions6,7,10,13. Let's see. Maybe group them into three parts. 6 and7 are in the second segment (5-9), 10 and13 are in the third segment (10-13). So two in each of two segments, but output has three numbers. Maybe the first segment has none, second two, third two. So output would be 0,2,2, but the output is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nMaybe the output isn't per segment but per the entire list. For example, the first output line [2,2,2] could mean that each of the three pairs of lists (the three transitions between the four input lists) has some commonality. Wait, but in Example0, there are three outputs, each being three numbers. For instance, the first output is [2,2,2], the second [8,8,8], third [3,3,3]. So each output list is three identical numbers. That's a pattern. So perhaps each transition between two lists generates a single number, and that number is repeated three times in the output line. So for each transition (from list1 to list2, list2 to list3, list3 to list4), we generate a number, then output it three times. So how to get that number.\n\nLooking at Example0, the first transition (input list1 to list2) gives output [2,2,2], which would imply the number is 2. How is 2 derived from the transition between list1 and list2.\n\nList1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\nList2: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nComparing them, the changes are at positions6,7,10,13. The values in list2 at these positions are 0. So four 0s added. But why the number 2?\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s introduced in the entire list. List1 has two 0s (positions4 and9). List2 has six 0s (positions4,6,7,9,10,13). So difference is four 0s added. But output number is 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the number of blocks of 5s. List1 has three blocks (each four 5s). List2 has more blocks. Let's count: in list2, the first block is [5,5,5,5], then 0, then [5], then 0,0, then [5], then 0,0, then [5,5], then 0. So the blocks of 5s are: 4,1,1,2. So four blocks. The difference from the original three blocks is +1. But output is 2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of transitions (from 5 to 0 or 0 to5) in the list. List1: transitions at 4 (5 to0), 9 (0 to5?), wait no. Wait list1 is [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. So transitions are at position4 (5\u21920), position5 (0\u21925), position9 (5\u21920), position10 (0\u21925). So four transitions. List2: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]. Transitions at position4 (5\u21920), position5 (0\u21925), position6 (5\u21920), position8 (0\u21925), position9 (5\u21920), position10 (0\u21920), position11 (0\u21925), position13 (5\u21920). So transitions at 4,5,6,8,9,11,13 \u2192 seven transitions. The difference is 7-4=3. Output is 2. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the numbers are related to the indices where the 0s are added. For example, in Example0, the new 0s are at positions6,7,10,13. Let's sum their digits. 6 \u21926, 7\u21927, 10\u21921+0=1, 13\u21921+3=4. Summing these:6+7+1+4=18. Then 18 divided by something. But the output is 2. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 0s added in pairs. In Example0, four 0s added (positions6,7,10,13), which are two pairs (6 and7, 10 and13). So two pairs. Hence the output 2. Then each transition's output is the number of such pairs. That could be. For Example0's first transition, four 0s added \u2192 two pairs \u2192 output [2,2,2]. Then the next transition is between list2 and list3. But list2 and list3 in Example0 are the same. So no changes. So zero pairs. But the output is [8,8,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example0, the input lists are:\n\nList1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\nList2: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\nList3: same as list2\nList4: same as list1.\n\nSo transitions:\n\nList1 to list2: four 0s added \u2192 two pairs \u2192 output 2.\n\nList2 to list3: no changes \u2192 zero \u2192 but output is [8,8,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: The output numbers could be the count of something in the input lists that's not directly obvious. Let's look at all examples.\n\nExample0 Outputs: [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]\n\nExample1 Outputs: [3,3,3], [4,4,4], [2,2,2]\n\nExample2: [8,8,8], [2,2,2], [4,4,4]\n\nExample3: [2,2,2], [4,4,4], [2,2,2]\n\nLooking for a pattern, the outputs are numbers 2,3,4,8. Hmm. Could these numbers represent digits on a seven-segment display? For example, 2 is the digit that uses segments a, b, g, e, d. But why would the numbers be related to that? Alternatively, the numbers could be counts of closed loops in the digits. Like, 8 has two loops, 0 has one, etc. But the numbers in the outputs are 2,3,4,8. 2 has no loops, 3 none, 4 none. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the numbers are the sum of the lengths of added 0 sequences. For example, in Example0's first transition, the new 0s are at positions6,7 (two consecutive 0s) and 10,13 (single 0s?). Wait, in list2, after position5 (which is 5), position6 and7 are 0,0. So a sequence of two 0s. Then position9 is 0, then 10 is 0, and 13 is 0. So sequences of two 0s (positions6-7), and then two single 0s (position9,10,13). Hmm. The lengths of added 0 sequences could be 2 (at 6-7) and two single 0s (but they are added in the second list). So sum of lengths: 2 +1 +1 +1 =5. Not 2. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a 0 is followed by another 0 in the modified list. For Example0's list2: there are sequences like 0,0 at positions6-7, and 0,0 at positions9-10. So two instances of consecutive 0s. So count is 2. That matches the first output [2,2,2]. Then the next transition is list2 to list3 (no changes), so no new consecutive 0s. So why output 8? Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is related to the positions where 0s are added, converted into some code. For example, position6 is 6 in hexadecimal is 6, but 6+7+10+13=36. 36 in hex is 24, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the list as a grid of 14 columns, and each input list as a row. The 0s represent empty spaces and 5s filled. Maybe the output is the number of enclosed areas (like how 8 has two loops). But visualizing the first list: all 5s except positions4 and9. So maybe the figure would have three solid blocks, but with gaps. Maybe the output counts the number of enclosed regions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the 0s as breaks in the sequence, and count the number of separate blocks of 5s. For example, in list2 of Example0, the blocks of 5s are: first four, then one, then one, then two. Total four blocks. The original list had three. So 4-3=1. But output is 2. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe each output number is the sum of the digits of the indices where the 0s are added. For Example0's first transition, added 0s at positions6,7,10,13. Sum of digits:\n\n6 \u21926, 7\u21927, 10\u21921+0=1,13\u21921+3=4. Total 6+7+1+4=18. 18 modulo something? 1+8=9. Not 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Look for patterns in the numbers across examples.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nTransitions:\n\n1-2: output 2, 8, 3.\n\nBut what's 2, 8, 3? Maybe they sum to 13. Not sure.\n\nExample1:\n\n3,4,2. Sum 9.\n\nExample2:\n\n8,2,4. Sum14.\n\nExample3:\n\n2,4,2. Sum8.\n\nNot obvious.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output numbers correspond to the number of times a certain pattern occurs in the transition. For example, when a 5 is changed to 0, and whether that creates a certain shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number in the output represents the number of times a particular pattern appears in the pair of lists. For example, in Example0's first transition, the 0s added form a vertical line in a grid if the lists are stacked. But the test input has four lists, so maybe arranged as rows. The output is determined by looking for certain shapes or patterns in the 0s.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers could be the count of 0s in each column across the three transitions. Wait, but in Example0's test input, the output has three lists. Let's look at the structure:\n\nEach training example's input has four lists (rows), and the output has three lists. So perhaps each output list corresponds to a certain aspect of the four input lists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 0s in certain positions across the input lists. For example, in Example0:\n\nThe input lists are:\n\nRow1: 0s at 4,9.\n\nRow2: 0s at 4,6,7,9,10,13.\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4: same as row1.\n\nThe outputs are three lists. Let's see if the positions of 0s in the rows relate to the outputs.\n\nLooking at the first output list [2,2,2]. Maybe each 2 represents the number of 0s in a particular column across the four input lists. For example, column4 (index4) has 0s in all four rows. So four 0s. But output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output list corresponds to the sum of 0s in certain positions. For example, the first output list could be the sum of 0s in positions 4,9, and 13 across the four input lists. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's rows:\n\nRow1: 0s at4,9.\n\nRow2: 4,6,7,9,10,13.\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4: same as row1.\n\nCount of 0s at position4: all four rows have 0 \u21924.\n\nPosition9: all four rows have 0 \u21924.\n\nPosition13: rows1 and4 do not have 0 (row1's last element is5), rows2 and3 have 0 at13. So count is 2.\n\nSumming 4+4+2=10. Not related to output [2,2,2]. Hmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think of each list as a binary number where 5 is 1 and 0 is 0. Then convert to decimal. But the lists are 14 elements long, which is a big number.\n\nFor Example0's first input list: 11110111101111. Let's convert that to decimal.\n\nBut this might not be feasible for the user to compute, and the outputs are small numbers like 2,3,4,8. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, consider the 0 positions as binary flags for certain values. For example, in the first list of Example0, 0s at positions4 and9. If we take those positions as bits in a binary number, but positions are up to 13, which would be 14 bits. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are related to the sum of the positions where 0s are introduced. For Example0's first transition, positions6,7,10,13. Sum is6+7+10+13=36. 36 divided by 18 is 2. So output 2. Then Example0's first output is 2. For the second transition (between list2 and list3, no changes), sum is0. 0 divided by something gives 8? No. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the indices modulo 9. 36 mod9 is 0. Not 2.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the test input and see if there's a pattern that could lead to the answer, then work backward.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nExpected output: ?\n\nLooking at the transitions between the four input lists:\n\nTransition1: list1 to list2.\n\nList1: 0s at4,9.\n\nList2: 0s at4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nSo added 0s at5,8,11,12.\n\nTransition2: list2 to list3.\n\nList3: 0s at1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nAdded 0s at1,2.\n\nTransition3: list3 to list4.\n\nList4: 0s at1,2,4,11,12.\n\nRemoved 0s at5,8,9, added 5 in those positions.\n\nBut how does this translate to output numbers?\n\nIf the output numbers are based on the number of added 0s in each transition:\n\nTransition1: added 4 0s \u2192 4/2=2 pairs \u2192 output 2.\n\nBut in Example0, four 0s added \u2192 output 2.\n\nTransition2: added 2 0s \u2192 output 1 (but in Example0's second transition, no changes \u2192 output8).\n\nDoesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s added in each transition.\n\nTest transition1: 4 0s added. If the output is 4, but Example0's first transition has four 0s added and output 2. So not.\n\nAlternatively, the number of newly added 0s in each of the three segments.\n\nIn test transition1 (list1 to list2):\n\nList1's segments (split by 0s):\n\nSegment1: 0-4: [5,5,5,5,0]\n\nSegment2:5-9: [5,5,5,5,0]\n\nSegment3:10-13: [5,5,5,5]\n\nList2's segments:\n\nSplit by 0s:\n\n0-4: [5,5,5,5,0]\n\n5:0 (position5 is 0), then position6-7:5,5 (but next 0 at8). So segment5-8: [0,5,5,0].\n\nPosition9 is0, then 10:5, 11:0, 12:0, 13:5.\n\nSo the segments are:\n\nSegment1: 0-4: [5,5,5,5,0]\n\nSegment2:5-8: [0,5,5,0]\n\nSegment3:9-13: [0,5,0,0,5]\n\nBut this is getting messy. The added 0s in transition1 are at positions5,8,11,12.\n\nThese are in segments:\n\nPosition5: in the second segment of list1 (5-9).\n\nPosition8: also in the second segment.\n\nPositions11 and12: in the third segment (10-13).\n\nSo in the second segment, added two 0s (positions5 and8).\n\nIn the third segment, added two 0s (11,12).\n\nSo two 0s in each of two segments. But output is three numbers. Maybe the first segment has 0 added, the second two, third two. So output would be 0,2,2, which is [0,2,2], but since outputs are three numbers repeated, maybe [2,2,2] if the sum is 4 (but not sure). Not matching earlier examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output number is the number of 0s added in each third of the list. Split the list into three parts:\n\nFirst third: positions0-4 (5 elements)\n\nSecond third: positions5-9 (5 elements)\n\nThird third: positions10-13 (4 elements)\n\nIn transition1 of test input:\n\nAdded 0s at5,8,11,12.\n\nPositions5 and8 are in the second third.\n\nPositions11 and12 are in the third third.\n\nSo second third: two 0s added.\n\nThird third: two 0s added.\n\nFirst third: none.\n\nSo output could be 0,2,2. But the output requires three numbers. Maybe each output list element is the sum of these, but then [0+2+2=4], but the example outputs are three numbers. Not matching.\n\nAnother Idea: Looking at the outputs across examples, notice that in Example0, the outputs are [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. Each output list has the same number repeated. So maybe each transition between input lists produces a single number which is then tripled. So the key is to find what that number represents.\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\nTransition1: list1 to list2 produces 2.\n\nTransition2: list2 to list3 (no changes) produces8.\n\nTransition3: list3 to list4 produces3.\n\nHmm. How could no changes produce 8?\n\nAlternatively, think of the transitions as representing the number of islands or connected regions of 5s. For example, list1 has three connected regions (segments). List2 has more regions. Maybe the output is the number of regions added.\n\nList1 to list2: regions increase from 3 to 4. So difference +1. But output is 2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of regions multiplied by something. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example0's first transition, the output is 2. If the number of 0s added is4, and 4/2=2. Maybe the output is the number of pairs of 0s added. In Example0, two pairs: positions6-7 (a pair of 0s) and positions10 and13 (single 0s, but maybe grouped into pairs). But no, 10 and13 are not consecutive. So only one pair (6-7). Then output 1, but example shows 2. Not matching.\n\nAnother Idea: The output numbers correspond to the number of times the pattern '0,5,0' appears in the list. Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think of the lists as representing a binary clock or something, where the 0s and5s are bits. But not sure.\n\nPerhaps the output numbers are the sum of the indices where 0s are added, modulo 10. For Example0, sum is6+7+10+13=36. 36 mod10=6. Not 2.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern in the examples.\n\nExample0's outputs are [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3].\n\nExample1's outputs are [3,3,3], [4,4,4], [2,2,2].\n\nExample2's outputs are [8,8,8], [2,2,2], [4,4,4].\n\nExample3's outputs are [2,2,2], [4,4,4], [2,2,2].\n\nNotice that 2,3,4,8 are the numbers used. Also, 8 and 2 appear in different orders. Could these numbers correspond to the number of holes in the digits when displayed on a seven-segment display?\n\n- 2 has no holes.\n- 3 has no holes.\n- 4 has no holes.\n- 8 has two holes.\n\nWait, but that doesn't explain the outputs. Or maybe the numbers represent the count of enclosed areas in the structure formed by the 0s and5s. For example, if a group of 0s forms a loop, the number of loops. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the number of times the pattern '5,0,5' appears in the list. For Example0's list2, after transition:\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0].\n\nLooking for '5,0,5':\n\nAt positions5-7:5,0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nAt positions8-10:5,0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nAt positions10-12:0,5,5 \u2192 no.\n\nNo occurrences. So output 2 for this would be incorrect.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output numbers are the sum of the lengths of the new 0 sequences introduced. For Example0's first transition, the new 0s are at6,7 (a sequence of 2), and 10 (single), 13 (single). Sum of lengths is2+1+1=4. But output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of new 0 sequences. In Example0's first transition, there are three new 0 sequences: positions6-7 (length2), position10 (length1), position13 (length1). So three sequences. But output is2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the count of 0s added in even positions. For Example0's first transition, added 0s at6 (even),7 (odd),10 (even),13 (odd). Even count:2. So output2. That fits! Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's first transition: even positions where 0s added are6 and10 \u2192 count2. Output is2. This seems promising.\n\nSecond transition in Example0 is list2 to list3, which are the same. So no new 0s added. Even count0. Output is8. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe it's the count of 0s added in even positions across all transitions. Not sure. Let's check Example1.\n\nExample1's first transition:\n\nInput list1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nInput list2: [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nCompare to find added 0s. Original list1 has 0s at4,9. List2 has 0s at0,3,4,9. So added 0s are at0,3.\n\nPositions0 and3: even indices? Let's see. Position0 is even (0 mod2=0), position3 is odd (3 mod2=1). So even positions added:1 (only position0). So count1. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe not.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each transition, look at the positions where the value changes from 5 to 0. Then count how many of these positions are even. For Example0's first transition, positions6 (even),7 (odd),10 (even),13 (odd). Even count:2. Output is2. This matches. Example0's first output is2. \n\nNext, the second transition in Example0 is between list2 and list3, which are identical. So no changes. Even count:0. But output is8. Doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother Idea: The number of added 0s multiplied by some factor. For Example0's first transition:4 0s added.4*0.5=2. Output2. Example1's first transition:2 0s added (positions0 and3). 2*1.5=3. Output3. This could work. Then Example0's second transition (0 0s added) \u21920* something=8. Not possible. So no.\n\nAlternatively, (number of added 0s) divided by 2. Example0 first transition:4/2=2. Example1 first transition:2/2=1. But output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the output number is the sum of the new 0 positions divided by 10. For Example0, sum 6+7+10+13=36. 36/18=2. 36/10=3.6 \u2192 rounded to4. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, sum of the positions divided by 9. 36/9=4. Output2. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think outside the box. Maybe the numbers are related to the letters of the alphabet. 2\u2192B, 3\u2192C, 4\u2192D, 8\u2192H. But what's the pattern with B, C, D, H. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers correspond to the number of letters in the spelled-out number. Two has 3 letters. But output is2. No.\n\nAnother Idea: The output numbers are the count of 0s in the corresponding row of the input. Let's check Example0:\n\nThe outputs are three lists. Each output list corresponds to a row in the output. For Example0's output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nBut how does this relate to the input lists? The input has four lists. The output has three lists. Maybe each output list corresponds to a certain aspect of the input lists. For example, the first output list could be the number of 0s in each of the first three input lists. Let's see:\n\nExample0's input lists:\n\nList1: 2 zeros.\n\nList2:6 zeros.\n\nList3:6 zeros.\n\nList4:2 zeros.\n\nBut the first output list is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s in each row of the input. For example, in Example0's input:\n\nRow1:2 zeros.\n\nRow2:6 zeros.\n\nRow3:6 zeros.\n\nRow4:2 zeros.\n\nBut outputs are three lists, not four. So maybe the output lists are the number of 0s in the second, third, and fourth rows minus the first. So row2- row1:6-2=4. row3- row2:0. row4- row3:2-6= -4. But the output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps each output number represents the number of 0s in a certain column across the four input lists. For example, in Example0's input lists:\n\nColumn4 (index4) has 0 in all four rows. So count is4. Column9: all four rows have 0. Count4. Column13: rows2 and3 have 0. Count2. So sum 4+4+2=10. Not related to output.\n\nAlternatively, if the output numbers are the number of columns that have a 0 in all four input lists. For Example0, columns4 and9 have 0s in all four rows. So count is2. So output [2,2,2]. This fits! Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's output first list is [2,2,2]. So if the first output list corresponds to the number of columns with all zeros in rows1-4. Wait, in Example0, columns4 and9 have zeros in all four rows. So two columns. So output is2. But the output list has three elements. Hmm. Maybe each output list corresponds to a different set of columns. Or perhaps each output element corresponds to a column group. For example, split columns into three groups. 14 columns: group1 (0-4), group2 (5-9), group3 (10-13). For each group, count the number of columns where all four input lists have 0.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nGroup1 (0-4): column4 has 0 in all four rows. So count1.\n\nGroup2 (5-9): column9 has 0 in all rows. So count1.\n\nGroup3 (10-13): none. So count0.\n\nTotal counts:1+1+0=2. But output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps each output list is determined by comparing adjacent input lists and counting certain patterns. For example, in the transition from list1 to list2, list2 to list3, list3 to list4. Each transition is compared, and for each, the number of times a 0 is introduced in even positions. \n\nFor Example0's first transition (list1 to list2):\n\nNew 0s at6 (even),7 (odd),10 (even),13 (odd). Even count:2. Output first element is2.\n\nSecond transition (list2 to list3): no new 0s. Even count0. Output second element is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nThird transition (list3 to list4): reverting back to list1. So new 0s are removed. But how does this generate 3?\n\nThis approach doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: The output numbers are the sum of the positions where 0s are added, then take modulo 9. For Example0's first transition:6+7+10+13=36 mod9=0. Output is2. No.\n\nAlternatively, sum of digits of each position. For Example0's first transition:\n\n6 \u21926\n\n7 \u21927\n\n10\u21921+0=1\n\n13\u21921+3=4\n\nTotal:6+7+1+4=18 \u21921+8=9. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. I might need to consider that each output number is the number of 0s added in certain positions modulo something. For Example0's first transition:4 0s added. 4 modulo something equals2. Like 4 mod 3=1. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the output number is the count of 0s added in even indices minus the count in odd indices. For Example0's first transition: even indices added 2 (6,10), odd indices added2 (7,13). 2-2=0. Output is2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the difference between the number of 0s in the new list and the old list. For Example0's first transition: new list has6 zeros, old has2. Difference4. Output2. 4/2=2. Example1's first transition: new list has5 zeros (list2), old list has2. Difference3. Output3. This fits! Let's check:\n\nExample0 first transition:6-2=4 \u21924/2=2 \u2192 output2.\n\nExample1's first transition: list2 has0,3,4,5,9. Wait list1 has0s at4,9. List2 has0s at0,3,4,5,9. So count5 zeros. 5-2=3 \u2192 output3.\n\nYes, this fits. Example1's first output is3. \n\nExample0's second transition is list2 to list3: same number of zeros (6-6=0). 0/2=0. Output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So maybe not.\n\nAnother Idea: The output number is the number of 0s added divided by2. Example0's first transition:4/2=2. Example1's first transition:3/2=1.5, but output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s added multiplied by something. Example0's first transition:4*0.5=2. Example1's first transition:3*1=3. This fits. But then for the second transition in Example0, which adds0 zeros, output is8. 0 multiplied by something is8. No.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the output numbers are the number of times the pattern of 0s in the list forms a certain shape. For example, in the list after the transition, the 0s might form a shape resembling the digit '2' when viewed as a grid. But how to visualize this.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the number of diagonal or adjacent 0s. For Example0's list2, the 0s are at4,6,7,9,10,13. Looking for adjacent 0s: positions6-7 (adjacent), 9-10 (adjacent). So two pairs. Output2. This fits.\n\nExample0's first output is2. Example1's first transition: list2 has0s at0,3,4,5,9. Adjacent 0s:0-1 (no), 3-4 (yes),4-5 (yes),5-6 (no),9-10 (no). So two pairs. Output3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern based on the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nFour lists.\n\nTransition1: list1 to list2.\n\nList1: 0s at4,9.\n\nList2: 0s at4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nAdded 0s at5,8,11,12.\n\nThese are four positions. If the output is based on the count of added 0s divided by2, then4/2=2. So output first element is2.\n\nTransition2: list2 to list3.\n\nList3: 0s at1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12.\n\nAdded 0s at1,2.\n\nCount is2 \u21922/2=1. Output second element would be1. But the examples have outputs like8 and others.\n\nTransition3: list3 to list4.\n\nList4: 0s at1,2,4,11,12.\n\nRemoved 0s at5,8,9.\n\nSo added 0s: none. Removed 0s:3. So output would be0. But examples have outputs like3.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the sum of the positions where 0s are added, divided by some number. For test transition1:5+8+11+12=36. 36/18=2. Output2.\n\nTransition2:1+2=3. 3/1=3. Output3.\n\nTransition3: no added 0s. Sum0. Output0.\n\nBut example outputs don't have zeros. So not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find the pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the training examples.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the outputs are three lists, each with three identical numbers. The test input has four lists, so three transitions. For each transition, the output is a single number repeated three times.\n\nIn the test input transitions:\n\nTransition1 (list1 to list2): added 0s at5,8,11,12. Four 0s added. In Example0's first transition, four 0s \u2192 output2. So perhaps this transition outputs2.\n\nTransition2 (list2 to list3): added 0s at1,2. Two 0s added. Example1's first transition had two 0s added and output3. But not sure.\n\nTransition3 (list3 to list4): removed three 0s. How this affects the output? In Example0's third transition, reverting to the original list, output3. So perhaps this transition outputs3.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, the outputs might be [8,8,8], [2,2,2], [4,4,4], based on the examples where similar transitions occurred.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's third transition, which has list3 and list4. List4 has 0s at1,2,4,11,12. So added 0s compared to list3: none, but removed 0s at5,8,9. So maybe the output is based on the number of 0s removed. For three 0s removed, but output3. Example0's third transition output3. \n\nSo possible outputs for the test input could be:\n\nTransition1: added 4 0s \u2192 output2.\n\nTransition2: added 2 0s \u2192 output3.\n\nTransition3: removed 3 0s \u2192 output3.\n\nBut the outputs need to be three lists. So maybe:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, some outputs have [3,3,3], [4,4,4], etc. It's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions added in test transition1: 5,8,11,12. The sum of their digits:\n\n5 \u21925\n\n8 \u21928\n\n11\u21921+1=2\n\n12\u21921+2=3\n\nTotal:5+8+2+3=18 \u21921+8=9. But output is2.\n\nThis doesn't help.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the training examples. For the test input, perhaps the outputs are [8,8,8], [2,2,2], [4,4,4], similar to Example2's outputs.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. So there are these input lists and output lists. Each example has four input arrays and three output arrays. Wait, the output is three arrays each with three numbers. Let me look at the examples closely.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is four arrays. The first array is [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. The other three arrays are different. The outputs are three arrays: [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. Hmm. Maybe each output array corresponds to comparing adjacent input arrays? Like the first output is between the first and second input array, the second between second and third, third between third and fourth?\n\nLet me check. For Example 0, the input arrays are:\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nRow3: same as row2\n\nRow4: same as row1\n\nOutputs are three arrays. So perhaps each output is generated by comparing row1-row2, row2-row3, row3-row4? Let's see what the output numbers could represent.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first output is [2,2,2]. Let's look at the difference between row1 and row2. Row1 and row2 are the same in some positions. Let's check each element:\n\nRow1: 5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5\n\nRow2:5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0\n\nComparing element by element where they differ:\n\nPositions 6,7,8,10,11,13:\n\nRow1 has 5,5,5,0,5,5\n\nRow2 has 0,0,5,0,0,0. Wait, wait. Let me list the indices. Let's index from 0.\n\nRow1: positions 0-13:\n\n0:5, 1:5, 2:5, 3:5,4:0,5:5,6:5,7:5,8:5,9:0,10:5,11:5,12:5,13:5.\n\nRow2:5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0.\n\nSo differences are at positions 6,7,10,11,12,13.\n\nWait, row1[6] is 5, row2[6] is 0: difference.\n\nSimilarly, row1[7] is 5 vs 0.\n\nRow1[10] is 5 vs 0.\n\nRow1[11] is 5 vs 5 (same), wait no. Wait row2[11] is 5. So positions 6,7,10,13 are different.\n\nWait row2[10] is 0, row1[10] is 5. So difference at 10. Also, row2[13] is 0 vs 5. So in row1 vs row2, there are 4 differences: positions 6,7,10,13.\n\nBut the output is [2,2,2]. Hmm, maybe the number of differences in certain sections?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output corresponds to the count of changes in specific segments. For example, the input arrays might be split into groups, and the number of changes in each group determines the output.\n\nLooking at the input arrays, they have 14 elements each. Maybe they are split into three parts. Let's see: 14 elements divided into three parts. 14 divided by 3 is roughly 4.666. Maybe the first part is 5 elements, then next 4, then next 5? Not sure. Or maybe the 0s act as separators. Let's look at the first array in Example 0:\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nThe 0s are at positions 4 and 9. So the array is split into three parts: 0-4 (before the first 0), 5-9 (up to the second 0), and 10-13. Wait, positions 4 and 9 are the 0s. So the segments would be:\n\nFirst segment: positions 0-3 (elements [5,5,5,5])\n\nSecond segment: positions 5-8 (elements [5,5,5,5])\n\nThird segment: positions 10-13 (elements [5,5,5,5])\n\nSo each segment is between the 0s. But in row2 of Example 0:\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nHere, the 0s are at positions 4,6,7,9,10,13.\n\nBut the segments would still be split by the 0s. Wait maybe the 0s act as separators, and each segment is the blocks between the 0s. So in the first input array, there are two 0s, so three segments. Let me check that.\n\nFirst array in Example 0:\n\nSegments:\n\nFirst: [5,5,5,5] (from start to first 0 at position4)\n\nSecond: [5,5,5,5] (from position5 to position9, which is the next 0 at 9)\n\nThird: [5,5,5,5] (from position10 to end, but there's a 0 at position9, so the third segment is from 10 onwards. But the original array ends at 13. So third segment is [5,5,5,5].\n\nIn row2 of Example 0:\n\nSegments:\n\nFirst: [5,5,5,5]\n\nSecond: starts at position5 (after the first 0). The next 0s are at positions6,7,9. So the second segment would be from position5 to position5 (since next 0 is at 6?), but that's just [5]. Then after 6, there's a 0, then another 0 at 7. So maybe the segments are split by each 0. So each time a 0 is encountered, a new segment starts. Wait that could be complicated. Alternatively, the 0s are separators, and each group is between the 0s. So for row2:\n\nSegments would be:\n\nFirst: 0-4: [5,5,5,5]\n\nThen between 4 and next 0: the next 0 is at position4 (the first 0), then the next is at position6. So segment from 5 (after 4) to 5 (before 6) is [5]. Then from 6 to next 0: 6 is 0, so next 0 is at 7. So segment from 7 to 7 (0), which is nothing. Then after 7 is 0, so next 0 is at 9. So from 8 to 8 (5). Then after 9, next 0 is at 10. So segment from 10 to 9 (since 9 is a 0), but that's not possible. This approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the segments are the three parts separated by the 0s, but only considering the 0s that are at the same positions as the first array. Because in the first array, the 0s are at positions4 and 9. So maybe all subsequent rows are split into segments based on these positions. So regardless of where the 0s are in other rows, the splits are at positions4 and 9. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0, row1 has 0s at 4 and9. So segments are:\n\n0-4 (exclusive?), wait positions0-4 (indices 0 to 3): first four elements, then 0 at index4. Then from index5 to 9 (but index9 is 0), so positions5-8 (elements5-8, which are four 5s), then from index10 onwards (positions10-13: four 5s). So three segments: first 4 elements, next 4 elements (positions5-8), then next 4 elements (positions10-13).\n\nBut how does this relate to the output? Let's look at the first output in Example0: [2,2,2]. This output corresponds to comparing row1 and row2. Let's check the differences between row1 and row2 in each segment.\n\nRow1 segments:\n\nSeg1: [5,5,5,5]\n\nRow2's seg1: same [5,5,5,5]. So no difference here.\n\nSeg2 in row1: [5,5,5,5]\n\nRow2's seg2: [5,0,0,5]. So differences at positions5 (5 vs5?), wait row2's seg2 is from 5-8. Let's get the actual elements.\n\nRow1's seg2 (positions5-8): elements5 is 5,6 is5,7 is5,8 is5. So [5,5,5,5].\n\nRow2's seg2 (positions5-8): elements5 is5,6 is0,7 is0,8 is5. So [5,0,0,5]. Comparing to row1's seg2, there are two differences (positions6 and7).\n\nSeg3 in row1: positions10-13: 5,5,5,5.\n\nRow2's seg3: positions10-13:0,5,5,0. Comparing to row1's 5,5,5,5: differences at positions10,13. So two differences.\n\nSo seg2 has two differences, seg3 has two differences. But the output is [2,2,2]. Wait, that would be three segments. But seg1 had no differences, seg2 had two, seg3 had two. But the output has three numbers. Hmm, maybe each output corresponds to the number of differences in each segment. But then in this case, first segment has 0, second 2, third 2. But the output is [2,2,2]. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output counts the number of 0s introduced in each segment when comparing the two rows. Let's see. In row1 vs row2.\n\nRow1's seg2 is all 5s. Row2's seg2 has two 0s. So maybe the output for seg2 is 2. Similarly, seg3 in row2 has two 0s (positions10 and13). So seg3 has 2. But the first output in example0 is [2,2,2]. But the first segment (seg1) has no changes. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of 0s in each segment of the second row. Let's check. In Example0, output is [2,2,2]. For row2, the segments:\n\nSeg1: [5,5,5,5] (no zeros).\n\nSeg2: [5,0,0,5] (two zeros).\n\nSeg3: [0,5,5,0] (two zeros). So total zeros per segment: 0,2,2. Sum to 4. But the output is [2,2,2], which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of transitions from 5 to 0 or 0 to 5 in each segment when comparing the two rows. Or maybe the number of runs of 0s introduced. Not sure.\n\nWait looking at the outputs in Example0: [2,2,2], [8,8,8], [3,3,3]. The outputs are three arrays each with three elements. Each array's elements are the same. So for each comparison between two rows, the output is three identical numbers. So each element in the output array represents something that's the same across the three segments. Maybe the sum of all differences across the segments, but that would be a single number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 0s in each row. Let's check. For example, in Example0, the outputs are three arrays. The first output is [2,2,2]. Let's see: row2 has 0s at positions4 (original 0), 6,7,9,10,13. So total 6 zeros. But [2,2,2] sums to 6. Maybe each element in the output array is the number of zeros in each segment of the compared row. So for row2, segments:\n\nSeg1: positions0-3: no zeros.\n\nSeg2: positions5-8: zeros at 6 and7 \u2192 two zeros.\n\nSeg3: positions10-13: zeros at10 and13 \u2192 two zeros. But how does that sum to [2,2,2]? Wait seg1 has 0, seg2 2, seg3 2. But the first output array is [2,2,2]. That doesn't add up. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is not based on the number of 0s but something else. Let's think of the numbers in the output as representing positions where the changes occurred. But in Example0, the first output is [2,2,2]. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nLet me look at another example. Take Example1:\n\nInputs:\n\nRow1: same as others.\n\nRow2: [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow4: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nOutputs: [3,3,3], [4,4,4], [2,2,2]\n\nLooking at the first output [3,3,3], which is the result of comparing row1 and row2.\n\nRow1's segments (based on original 0s at4 and9):\n\nSeg1: 0-3:5,5,5,5 \u2192 row2's seg1 is [0,5,5,0]. So comparing each element:\n\nSeg1: 0 vs5 (diff),5 vs5 (same),5 vs5 (same),0 vs5 (diff). So two differences.\n\nSeg2: row1's seg2 is 5,5,5,5. Row2's seg2 (positions5-8):5,5,5,5 \u2192 same. So no differences.\n\nSeg3: row1's seg3:5,5,5,5. Row2's seg3 (positions10-13):5,5,5,5 \u2192 same. So differences only in seg1. But output is [3,3,3]. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let's think about the output numbers. They are 2, 3,4,8. So maybe binary representations? 2 is 10, 3 is 11, 4 is 100, 8 is 1000. Not sure. Or maybe the numbers relate to the positions where changes occur. For example, in Example0's first output [2,2,2], maybe there are two changes in each segment. Wait but earlier analysis showed that in the first comparison, seg2 and seg3 had two changes each, but seg1 had none. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of 5s turned into 0s in each segment when comparing the two rows. Let's check Example0's first output.\n\nComparing row1 and row2:\n\nIn row2, where are the 0s that were 5s in row1? Looking at row2's elements:\n\nPositions6:0 (was 5 in row1)\n\nPosition7:0 (was5)\n\nPosition10:0 (was5)\n\nPosition13:0 (was5). So four positions where 5 became 0. But the output is [2,2,2]. If each segment counts the number of 5\u21920 changes:\n\nSeg1: no changes (0)\n\nSeg2: positions6 and7 \u2192 2 changes.\n\nSeg3: positions10 and13 \u2192 2 changes. So total 4. But the output array is [2,2,2]. So each segment's count is 0, 2, 2, but the output is three 2s. That doesn't fit. Unless the first segment's count is also 2, which it isn't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the digits in the segments. Like, each segment's sum of 5s, but divided by 5. For example, seg1 has four 5s: 4*5=20 \u2192 20/5=4. Not sure. But output numbers are 2,3,4,8, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of groups of consecutive 5s in each segment. For example, in row2's seg2 (5,0,0,5), there are two groups of 5s. So maybe 2. But then the output would be [2,2,2] for Example0's first output, but how does that relate to other examples?\n\nIn Example1's first output [3,3,3], comparing row1 and row2. Row2's seg1 is [0,5,5,0]. So the groups of 5s are between the 0s: two 5s. So two groups. But the output is 3. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each output corresponds to the number of 0s in each row. For example, in Example0's output [2,2,2], perhaps each of the three output arrays refers to the number of 0s in each row (rows2,3,4). Let's check:\n\nRow2 in Example0 has 0s at positions4,6,7,9,10,13 \u2192 6 zeros.\n\nBut the output is [2,2,2], which would be 6 zeros total. But 6 divided by 3 outputs? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each output array is for a particular comparison. For instance, each output array corresponds to the comparison between two consecutive input rows. So in the training examples, there are four input rows, leading to three output arrays. Each output array has three elements, perhaps indicating some measure for each of the three segments in the compared rows.\n\nIn Example0, comparing row1 and row2:\n\nLooking at the changes in each segment. Seg1 (0-3): no changes. Seg2 (5-8): two 5s turned to 0. Seg3 (10-13): two 5s turned to 0. So two changes in seg2 and two in seg3. The output is [2,2,2]. So maybe for each segment, the number of changes, but how are the three elements determined?\n\nWait, if the output array has three elements, each being the count of changes in each segment. For the first comparison (row1 vs row2), seg1 has 0 changes, seg2 has 2, seg3 has 2. But the output is [2,2,2]. That doesn't add up. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array's elements are the sum of the differences in each segment, but divided by something. For example, each 5 to 0 change is considered a difference of 5, and sum those in each segment. Then maybe divide by 5. For example, in Example0's first comparison:\n\nSeg1: no changes \u2192 0.\n\nSeg2: two changes \u2192 2*5=10 \u2192 10/5=2.\n\nSeg3: two changes \u2192 same. So the output would be [0,2,2]. But the output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit. But maybe they ignore the first segment and take the sum of all changes. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the positions where the changes occurred. For example, in Example0's first comparison, changes are at positions6,7,10,13. But how do these positions translate to the numbers 2,2,2?\n\nHmm. Another angle: maybe the output numbers are related to the indices of the segments where changes occurred. For instance, in each segment, if there's a change, the index is noted. But the output numbers are 2,3,4,8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be the number of elements changed in each segment, but multiplied by some factor. Like, in Example0's first comparison: seg2 has 2 changes, seg3 has 2, so output elements are 2 each. But why three elements? Unless each output array corresponds to a different aspect. Maybe not.\n\nLet me check another example. Example3's input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow4: same as row3.\n\nOutput: [2,2,2], [4,4,4], [2,2,2]\n\nComparing row1 and row2: no changes. So output [2,2,2] would be unexpected. So that suggests my previous approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is not based on comparing consecutive rows, but something else. Maybe each output array corresponds to the current row, processing all rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of zeros in each segment of the three rows below the first. For example, in Example0, there are three output arrays. Let's see:\n\nRow2: zeros in segments:\n\nSeg1:0, Seg2:2, Seg3:2 \u2192 total 4 zeros. But first output is [2,2,2]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are related to the sum of the elements in each segment. For example, each segment's sum divided by 5. For instance, in row2 of Example0:\n\nSeg1: 5*4=20 \u2192 20/5=4.\n\nSeg2:5+0+0+5=10 \u2192 10/5=2.\n\nSeg3:0+5+5+0=10 \u219210/5=2. So sum would be [4,2,2]. But the output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the elements in each segment (as 5s) but divided by some number. Maybe the count of 5s in each segment.\n\nSeg1 in row2 has four 5s \u2192 count 4 \u2192 but output is 2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of transitions between 5 and 0 in each segment. For example, in row2's seg2:5,0,0,5 \u2192 transitions: 5\u21920 (one), 0\u21920 (none), 0\u21925 (one). Total two transitions. So output 2. Similarly for seg3:0\u21925,5\u21925,5\u21920 \u2192 two transitions. So output per segment would be [0,2,2]. But the first output array is [2,2,2], which doesn't align.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's think of another approach. The output numbers are 2,3,4,8. Perhaps they are the counts of some pattern in the segments, like the number of runs or sequences of 5s. Let's check Example0's row2:\n\nSeg1:5,5,5,5 \u2192 one run.\n\nSeg2:5,0,0,5 \u2192 two runs.\n\nSeg3:0,5,5,0 \u2192 two runs.\n\nIf the output is the number of runs of 5s in each segment, then seg1 has 1, seg2 2, seg3 2. But the output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit. Unless the output is the number of runs multiplied by something.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the number of 0s in each segment of the row, but then in Example0's row2:\n\nSeg1:0 zeros.\n\nSeg2:2 zeros.\n\nSeg3:2 zeros. So output would be [0,2,2]. But the actual output is [2,2,2]. So that's not it.\n\nWait, but maybe the output is the number of 0s in each segment of the row being compared. For example, when comparing row1 and row2, the output is based on row2. But then, if the output is [2,2,2], row2's segments have 0,2,2 zeros. But the output is three 2s, which doesn't match. Maybe it's the sum of zeros in all segments, but divided by something. 0+2+2=4, but output is 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the difference in the number of 5s between the two rows in each segment. For example, row1 has 4 5s in seg1, row2 has 4. So difference 0. Seg2: row1 has 4, row2 has 2. Difference -2. Seg3: row1 has4, row2 has2. Difference -2. But output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the output array is the length of the longest consecutive sequence of 5s in each segment. For Example0's row2:\n\nSeg1: all 5s \u2192 length4.\n\nSeg2:5,0,0,5 \u2192 longest is 1.\n\nSeg3:0,5,5,0 \u2192 longest is2. But output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the count of something else. Like the number of 5s in the segment, modulo 10. For example, seg1 has4, 4 mod 10=4. But output is 2. Not matching.\n\nThis is challenging. Maybe I need to look for another pattern. The outputs are three arrays, each with three identical numbers. Each number is the same within the array. So perhaps for each comparison between two rows, each of the three segments has a certain value, and those values are summed or something to give the same number for each position.\n\nFor example, in Example0's first output [2,2,2], maybe each segment contributes 2 to each element of the array, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the total number of changes across all segments, and each array element is that total. For Example0's first comparison, changes are 4 (2 in seg2 and 2 in seg3). So the output would be [4,4,4]. But the actual output is [2,2,2]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array is based on the sum of the differences in each segment multiplied by some factor. For example, 2 changes in two segments sum to 4, but output is 2. So 4/2=2. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example0's first output [2,2,2], perhaps each segment contributes a value of 2, regardless of their individual changes. Maybe the total number of changes across all segments is 4, and 4 divided by 2 gives 2. But why divided by 2? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are based on the positions where the changes occurred. For example, in Example0's first comparison, changes are at positions6,7,10,13. If you add those: 6+7+10+13=36. But 36 divided by 18 (number of elements?) gives 2. So output 2. But how does that lead to three elements all being 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of changes in the entire row, divided by the number of segments. In Example0's first comparison, 4 changes over 2 segments (seg2 and seg3) \u2192 4/2=2. So each element in the output array is 2. That might explain [2,2,2]. Let's test this with Example1's first output [3,3,3]. \n\nExample1's first comparison is row1 vs row2. How many changes are there?\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow2: [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nComparing each element:\n\nPositions0:5\u21920 (diff)\n\nPosition3:5\u21920 (diff)\n\nPosition4:0\u21920 (same)\n\nPosition5:5\u21925 (same)\n\nEtc. So changes at positions0,3. So two changes. So total changes is 2. Divided by 3 segments (assuming three segments), 2/3 is not an integer. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the binary representations of the changes. For example, in Example0's first comparison, four changes. But 4 in binary is 100, which is 4, not 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each output array corresponds to the sum of the digits in each segment of the row, where 5 is considered a digit. For Example0's row2:\n\nSeg1:5,5,5,5 \u2192 sum 20. 20 mod 10 is 0, but output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the digits divided by 5. 20/5=4. Not 2.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 5s in the segment minus the number of 0s. For Example0's row2 seg2: 2 5s, 2 0s \u2192 0. Not 2.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the output is the number of 0s in each segment multiplied by the segment index. For example, seg1:0*1=0, seg2:2*2=4, seg3:2*3=6. But the output is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 0s introduced in each segment when compared to the original row. For example, in Example0's row2, seg2 has two new 0s (compared to row1). Seg3 has two new 0s. So total 4. But the output is [2,2,2]. So maybe each segment's new 0s are counted, and the sum is spread across the array elements. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of 0s in the entire row, and each element is the count divided by the number of segments. For Example0's row2, 6 zeros. 6 divided by 3 segments \u2192 2 per segment. Hence [2,2,2]. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's first output is [3,3,3]. Row2 has how many zeros? Let's see:\n\nRow2: [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nZeros at positions0,3,4,9. So four zeros. 4 divided by 3 segments \u2192 not integer. So that doesn't fit. Unless they round up. 4/3 is 1.33, which doesn't match the output of 3.\n\nHmm. Another example: Example3's output [2,2,2], [4,4,4], [2,2,2]. For the second output [4,4,4], what's the row3's zeros count?\n\nRow3 in Example3: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nZeros at positions4,6,7,9 \u2192 four zeros. 4 divided by 3 segments would be ~1.33. But output is [4,4,4]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach doesn't hold. Back to the drawing board.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input is:\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow3: [5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nNeed to apply the pattern to generate three output arrays.\n\nLet's try to find the pattern from the training examples. Maybe each output array is based on the number of 0s added in specific positions when moving from one row to the next.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are derived by counting the number of times a 0 appears in certain positions across the rows. Or perhaps it's based on the number of 0s in each of the three segments defined by the original row's 0s (positions4 and9).\n\nLet me try this approach. In the original row (row1 of each example), the 0s are at positions4 and9. So the three segments are:\n\nSeg1: indices0-3 (four elements).\n\nSeg2: indices5-8 (four elements).\n\nSeg3: indices10-13 (four elements).\n\nFor each comparison between consecutive rows, count the number of 0s introduced in each of these three segments. \n\nFor Example0's first comparison (row1 vs row2):\n\nRow1 has no 0s in any segments except the original 0s. Row2's seg1 has no 0s. Seg2 has two 0s (positions6 and7). Seg3 has two 0s (positions10 and13). So the output is [2,2,2], which matches the first output array of Example0.\n\nFor Example1's first comparison (row1 vs row2):\n\nRow2's seg1 has two 0s (positions0 and3). Seg2 has no 0s. Seg3 has no 0s. So total 2,0,0. But the output is [3,3,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this doesn't align. But wait, perhaps the count includes the existing 0s. For example, in row1's seg2, there are no 0s. In row2's seg2, are there any 0s? Let's see:\n\nRow2 in Example1 is [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]. The original row1's segments are defined by positions4 and9. So seg2 is positions5-8: 5,5,5,5. No 0s. So in row2's seg2, no 0s. So the output would be:\n\nSeg1: two 0s (positions0 and3).\n\nSeg2:0.\n\nSeg3:0.\n\nBut the output is [3,3,3]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the count of 0s in the row's segments, regardless of previous state.\n\nExample0's row2 has:\n\nSeg1:0 zeros.\n\nSeg2: two zeros.\n\nSeg3: two zeros.\n\nBut the output is [2,2,2], which would be the total zeros per segment. But seg1 has 0. So this can't be.\n\nBut wait, maybe the output is the number of zeros in each segment of the second row in the comparison. For Example0's first output, row2's seg1 has 0, seg2 has2, seg3 has2. But the output is [2,2,2]. So it's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the zeros in all segments of the second row. Example0's row2 has 0+2+2=4. But output is [2,2,2]. So 4 divided by 2 segments? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe the pattern is something else. Let's think about the outputs and their corresponding inputs.\n\nExample0's outputs are:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nExample1's outputs are:\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nExample2's outputs:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nExample3's outputs:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nNotice that the outputs include numbers like 2,3,4,8. These numbers could be related to the positions of the changes. For instance, 8 in binary is 1000, which is position3 (if counting from 0). But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps each output number is the product of the number of zeros in each segment. For Example0's first output, the product is 0*2*2=0. Not 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 0s in the entire row, and each output array element is that count. For Example0's row2, 6 zeros. But output is [2,2,2]. 6 divided by 3 gives 2. So each array element is 6/3=2. That could work. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's first output [3,3,3]. Row2 has 4 zeros. 4/3 is not an integer. So no.\n\nExample3's first output [2,2,2]. Row2 has 6 zeros? Row2 in Example3 is the same as row1, which has 2 zeros (positions4 and9). So 2/3 would give 0.666. Doesn't fit.\n\nNot this.\n\nAnother idea: The output numbers are the sum of the indices where 0s are introduced. For Example0's first comparison:\n\nChanges are positions6,7,10,13. Sum is6+7+10+13=36. 36 divided by (number of changes) 4 =9. Doesn't match output 2.\n\nAlternatively, the sum modulo 10. 36 mod10=6. Still not 2.\n\nAlternatively, the number of changes in each segment. Example0's first comparison has two changes in seg2 and two in seg3. So sum is4. 4 divided by 2 gives 2. So output is 2 for each array element. But why three elements?\n\nPerhaps the output arrays are generated by taking the sum of changes in all segments and then each element is that sum. For Example0's first output, sum is4, so each element is4. But actual output is [2,2,2]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the count of 0s in the row being compared (not the difference from previous row). For Example0's row2 has 6 zeros. 6 divided by 3 gives 2. So each output element is2. This fits. Let's check Example1's first output [3,3,3]. Row2 in Example1 has4 zeros. 4/3=1.333. Doesn't fit. So no.\n\nBut wait, in Example3's first output [2,2,2], row2 has 2 zeros (positions4 and9). 2 divided by3 is 0.666. So not.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of each output array as a three-digit number where each digit is the same, like 222, 888, 333. Maybe these numbers represent something in octal or another base.\n\n222 in octal is 2*64 + 2*8 +2 = 146. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the numbers in each output array. For Example0's outputs: 2+2+2=6, 8+8+8=24, 3+3+3=9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are ASCII codes. 2 is STX (start of text), 3 is ETX (end of text), 4 is EOT, 8 is backspace. Not likely.\n\nAnother angle: The output numbers correspond to the number of times a 0 appears in each of the three positions where the original row had 0s. But the original row has 0s at positions4 and9. So three positions? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each output array's number is the count of 0s in the entire row that are not in the original positions (4 and9). For Example0's row2: zeros at4,6,7,9,10,13. Original zeros are4 and9. So new zeros are6,7,10,13 \u21924 zeros. 4 divided by 3 gives 1.333. But output is [2,2,2]. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow3: [5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nAssuming the output is three arrays, each corresponding to comparing consecutive rows.\n\nLet's compare row1 and row2:\n\nRow1's 0s are at4 and9.\n\nRow2's 0s are at4,5,8,9,10,12,13.\n\nChanges from row1 to row2:\n\nPosition5:5\u21920\n\nPosition8:5\u21920\n\nPosition10:5\u21920\n\nPosition12:5\u21920\n\nPosition13:5\u21925 (same).\n\nWait, row2: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nSo positions5,8,9,10,12 are new 0s.\n\nSo in segments:\n\nSeg1 (0-3): no changes.\n\nSeg2 (5-8): positions5 and8 are 0s. Position5 is in seg2 (since seg2 starts at5). So in seg2, row2 has 0 at5,8.\n\nRow1's seg2:5,5,5,5 \u2192 row2's seg2:0,5,5,0. So two new zeros.\n\nSeg3 (10-13): row2's seg3 has5,0,0,5 \u2192 positions10 and12 are 0s. So two new zeros.\n\nSo changes are two in seg2 and two in seg3. Total four changes. But if the output is based on that, what would the number be? In Example0's first comparison, two changes in seg2 and two in seg3, output [2,2,2]. So perhaps the sum of changes per segment (2+2=4) and output is 4/2=2. So each element is 2. So the first output array would be [2,2,2].\n\nThen compare row2 and row3:\n\nRow3: [5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nSeg1 (0-3): row2's seg1:5,5,5,5 \u2192 row3's seg1:5,0,0,5 \u2192 two new zeros. So two changes.\n\nSeg2 (5-8): row2's seg2:0,5,5,0 \u2192 row3's seg2:0,5,5,0 \u2192 no changes.\n\nSeg3 (10-13): row2's seg3:5,0,0,5 \u2192 row3's seg3:5,0,0,5 \u2192 no changes. So total two changes in seg1. So sum is 2. Output array would be [2,2,2]? But in the training examples, Example0's second output is [8,8,8]. So this approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers could be the sum of the indices where changes occurred. For example, comparing row2 and row3 in the test input:\n\nChanges at positions1,2: 5\u21920 in row3.\n\nSum of indices:1+2=3. So output array [3,3,3]. But in Example0's second output is [8,8,8]. For Example0's row2 to row3, which are the same, so no changes. So sum would be 0. But output is [8,8,8]. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output numbers are the result of some bitwise operations on the segments. For example, treating each segment as a binary number (5 as 1 and 0 as 0). For Example0's row2 seg2:5,0,0,5 \u2192 binary 1001 \u2192 decimal 9. But output is8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 5 is considered as 1 and 0 as 0. So seg2 of row2 in Example0 is 5,0,0,5 \u2192 1001 which is 9, but output is8. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the positions where 0s are present. For Example0's row2: zeros at4,6,7,9,10,13. Sum is4+6+7+9+10+13=49. 49 divided by something... Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe each output array corresponds to the sum of the elements in the three segments, converted to some number. For Example0's row2:\n\nSeg1 sum:5*4=20.\n\nSeg2 sum:5+0+0+5=10.\n\nSeg3 sum:0+5+5+0=10.\n\nTotal sum:40. 40 divided by something. But output is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the product of the segment sums divided by some number. 20*10*10=2000. 2000/1000=2. So [2,2,2]. That's possible. Let's check Example1's first output [3,3,3].\n\nRow2 in Example1: seg1 sum is0+5+5+0=10.\n\nSeg2 sum:5+5+5+5=20.\n\nSeg3 sum:5+5+5+5=20.\n\nProduct:10*20*20=4000. Divided by 4000/1333.33\u22483. So output 3. That could work. 4000/1333\u22483.\n\nExample3's first output [2,2,2]. Row2 is same as row1. Seg sums:20,20,20. Product:20*20*20=8000. 8000/4000=2. So output 2. That fits.\n\nTest input's first comparison (row1 vs row2):\n\nRow2's segments:\n\nSeg1 sum:5*4=20.\n\nSeg2 sum:0+5+5+0=10.\n\nSeg3 sum:5+0+0+5=10.\n\nProduct:20*10*10=2000. 2000/1000=2. Output [2,2,2].\n\nThat seems to fit. For Example0's first output.\n\nExample0's second output [8,8,8]. Comparing row2 and row3. Since they are the same, the product is the same as row2: 20*10*10=2000. But output is8. Hmm. This approach doesn't fit.\n\nWait, row2 and row3 are the same in Example0. So the product would be the same, but output is8. So this approach is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the sum of the segment sums divided by 10.\n\nFor Example0's first comparison: 20+10+10=40. 40/10=4. Output is2. No.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on the observation that in Example0, the output is [2,2,2] for row2, which has 6 zeros. 6/3=2. So each array element represents the average number of zeros per segment. For row2 in Example0: 0,2,2 zeros per segment. Average is (0+2+2)/3=1.33. Not 2. So no.\n\nBut perhaps the output is the maximum number of zeros in any segment. For Example0's row2, max is2. So output 2. But the array has three elements all 2. That could make sense if each element is the max. But in Example1's first output, row2 has two zeros in seg1, and others zero. Max is2. But output is3.\n\nNot matching.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the assumption that each output array's elements are the number of zeros in each segment of the compared row (the second row in each comparison). For Example0's first output, row2's segments have 0, 2, 2 zeros. But output is [2,2,2], which doesn't fit. So this is wrong.\n\nBut given the test input's rows, let's try to apply the pattern used in the examples. For the test input's rows:\n\nComparing row1 and row2:\n\nRow1's 0s at4 and9.\n\nRow2's 0s at4,5,8,9,10,12,13.\n\nIn the segments:\n\nSeg1 (0-3): row2 has no zeros. So 0 zeros.\n\nSeg2 (5-8): row2 has zeros at5,8. So two zeros.\n\nSeg3 (10-13): row2 has zeros at10,12. So two zeros.\n\nSo per segment zeros:0,2,2. But the output for this comparison would need to be [2,2,2]. According to Example0's first output, which had the same per-segment zeros. So the output would be [2,2,2].\n\nThen compare row2 and row3:\n\nRow3's zeros are at4,5,8,9,10,12,13. But also at positions1,2.\n\nSeg1 (0-3): row3 has zeros at1,2. So two zeros.\n\nSeg2 (5-8): zeros at5,8. Two zeros.\n\nSeg3 (10-13): zeros at10,12. Two zeros.\n\nPer-segment zeros:2,2,2. Output would be [2,2,2]. But in the training examples, when this happens, the output is [2,2,2], like in Example0's first output. But some examples have different outputs.\n\nFinally, comparing row3 and row4:\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5].\n\nSeg1 (0-3): row4 has zeros at1,2. So two zeros.\n\nSeg2 (5-8): row4 has5,5,5,5. No zeros.\n\nSeg3 (10-13): no zeros. \n\nSo per-segment zeros:2,0,0. But the output would need to be something like [0,0,0], but in the training examples, such as Example0's third output [3,3,3], which doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example3's third output is [2,2,2], which corresponds to a comparison where the new row has zeros in seg1 and seg3.\n\nThis is confusing. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output is the number of zeros in each segment of the second row in the comparison, and the array elements are those counts. For the test input:\n\nFirst comparison (row1 vs row2):\n\nSeg zeros:0,2,2 \u2192 output [0,2,2]. But the training examples have outputs with identical elements, so this approach is incorrect. So perhaps the output is the sum of the zeros in each segment. For example, 0+2+2=4, so each element is4. But in Example0's first output it's [2,2,2], which doesn't fit. So this is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to answer, I'll make an educated guess based on the pattern that each output array's elements are the number of 0s in the second row of the comparison, divided by some factor. For Example0's row2 has6 zeros. 6/3=2 \u2192 [2,2,2]. Example1's row2 has4 zeros. 4/3=1.333. Not fitting. But in Example3's row2 has2 zeros. 2/3=0.666. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the number of 0s in the entire row, and each element is that count. For Example0's row2 has6 zeros \u2192 output [6,6,6], but actual output is [2,2,2]. So no.\n\nGiven that all outputs in the training examples have three identical numbers, and the numbers are 2,3,4,8, perhaps the pattern is based on the number of times a certain condition is met in each row. For example, the number of 0s introduced in a row compared to the first row. For the test input:\n\nRow2 has5 new zeros (positions5,8,10,12,13) compared to row1. So output [5,5,5]. But this doesn't match the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the positions of new zeros. For row2 compared to row1: positions5,8,10,12. Sum=5+8+10+12=35. 35 divided by something. Not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make a best guess. Looking at the training examples, the outputs often have [2,2,2], [4,4,4], [8,8,8], etc. These numbers could be related to the number of 0s in specific segments. For the test input's first comparison, row2 has two zeros in seg2 and two in seg3. The sum is4. Divided by 2 (since two segments have changes), gives 2. So output [2,2,2]. \n\nSecond comparison (row2 to row3): row3 introduces two zeros in seg1. So sum is2. Output [2,2,2].\n\nThird comparison (row3 to row4): row4 removes zeros in seg2 and seg3, but adds zeros in seg1. So maybe two zeros in seg1. Output [2,2,2]. \n\nBut according to Example0's third output [3,3,3], when comparing row3 and row4 (which are the same as row1), the output is3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the number of changes in each segment, summed and divided by the number of segments with changes. For the test input's first comparison: two segments with changes (seg2 and seg3) each with two changes. So (2+2)/2=2 \u2192 [2,2,2].\n\nSecond comparison: one segment with changes (seg1, two changes). So 2/1=2 \u2192 [2,2,2].\n\nThird comparison: row4 has seg1 with two zeros (same as row3), seg2 and seg3 with no zeros. So no changes. So output [0,0,0]. But the training examples don't have such outputs.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll proceed with the guess that each output array's elements are the sum of zeros in the compared row's segments divided by the number of segments. For example, row2 in test input's first comparison has 0+2+2=4 zeros. 4/3=1.333, but output is [2,2,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nFinal guess: The output arrays are [3,3,3], [2,2,2], [4,4,4], based on the training examples where similar row comparisons led to these outputs. But I'm not confident.",
