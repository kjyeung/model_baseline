        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a 9 and 3 in the third row, and 7 and 8 in the fourth. The output adds numbers around the borders. The top rows have 8 and 7, and the bottom rows have 3 and 9. Hmm. Maybe the numbers are mirrored or swapped in some way. Like, 9 and 3 in the input, and in the output, the bottom has 3 and 9. Wait, no. The output's bottom rows have 3,3 and 9,9. So perhaps the numbers from the original positions are being used to create borders. Let's look at the positions.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the non-zero numbers are in rows 2 and 3 (if we start counting from 0). The output has top rows filled with 8 and 7, and bottom with 3 and 9. Wait, maybe the numbers from the input cells are being used as borders. Let me check the numbers: original cells are 9,3 and 7,8. Then in the output, the top left is 8,8 and 8,8. The top right is 7,7. The bottom left is 3,3 and 3,3. The bottom right is 9,9. So maybe the numbers are the sum of adjacent cells or something else. Wait, 9 and 7 in the original input's third and fourth rows. How do 8 and 7 come into play? Wait, 9 and 3 are in row 2, columns 2 and 3. 7 and 8 are in row 3, columns 2 and 3. Then in the output, the top left corners (rows 0 and 1, columns 0-1 and 4-5) have 8 and 7. The bottom left (rows 4 and 5, columns 0-1) have 3,3 and 3,3, and bottom right (columns 4-5) have 9,9. So maybe the numbers from the input's cells are being mirrored or placed in the corners. Like, the top left uses the number from row3, column3 (which is 8) and the top right uses row3, column2 (7). Wait, in example 0's input, row3 has 7,8. So 7 is column2, 8 column3. The top left in the output is 8, which is 8 from column3. The top right is 7, which is 7 from column2. Similarly, the bottom left uses 3 from row2 column3 (original input's 3) and the bottom right uses 9 from row2 column2. Wait, no. Because the original 3 is in row2 column3. The bottom left in output has 3s. So maybe the bottom left takes the value from the original cell's opposite? Like, the cell's value is mirrored to the opposite quadrant. For example, in example 0, the 9 and 3 are in the top middle. The output's bottom right has 9s. Maybe the numbers from the top middle are flipped to the bottom, and the numbers from the bottom middle (7,8) are flipped to the top. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero cells in the input are acting as \"sources\" and their values are being placed in the corners in the output. Let's look at example 0's output. The non-zero cells in the input are 9,3,7,8. In the output, the corners have 8,7,3,9. So 8 and 7 are from 7 and 8 (but reversed?), and 3 and9 are from 3 and9. Wait, 8 and7: 7 and8 are in the input's row3. So maybe the top left takes 8 (from row3 column3), top right takes 7 (row3 column2). Then bottom left takes 3 (row2 column3), and bottom right takes9 (row2 column2). So each of the original cells is mirrored to a corner. For example, the cell (2,2) with 9 is mirrored to the bottom right corner (rows 4-5, columns4-5). Similarly, (2,3) with3 is mirrored to the bottom left. (3,2) with7 to the top right, (3,3) with8 to the top left. Then the corners are filled with 2x2 blocks of those values.\n\nLooking at example 1's input. The non-zero cells are in row1 (4,6), row2 (2,1). Output's top has 1 in row0, column0. Then in the top left corner, maybe the 1 from (2,2) (since row2 column2 is1?), but in example1's input, row2 column2 is1. Then the output's top left has 1,0,0, etc. Wait, example1's output first row is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. Hmm. The non-zero input cells are 4,6 (row1 columns1-2), 2,1 (row2 columns1-2). The output's top left has 1 (from 1 in row2 column2?), the top right has 2,2 (from row2 column1 which is 2?), and the bottom left has6,6 (from row1 column2 which is6?), and the bottom right has4,4 (from row1 column1 which is4). So maybe each non-zero cell in the input is mapped to a corner. Like, each cell (i,j) in the input with value v is mirrored to a corner. The mapping could be based on their original positions. For example:\n\n- Cells in the upper left quadrant (positions (0-2,0-2) in a 6x6 grid) might be mapped to certain corners. Wait, perhaps the original cells are part of a central 2x2 or 2x4 area, and their positions determine where their values are placed in the corners.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original non-zero cells are in a 2x2 block in the center. Let's check the positions. In example0, the non-zero cells are at (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3). So a central 2x2 block. Then, their values are mirrored to the four corners. For example, (2,2) (which is the top left of the central block) goes to the bottom right corner. (2,3) (top right of central block) goes to the bottom left. (3,2) (bottom left of central block) goes to the top right. (3,3) (bottom right of central block) goes to the top left. Then, each of those corners in the output is filled with 2x2 blocks of the mirrored value.\n\nSo in example0:\n\nCentral cells:\n\n(2,2) =9 \u2192 mirrored to bottom right (rows4-5, cols4-5) \u2192 filled with 9,9.\n\n(2,3)=3 \u2192 mirrored to bottom left (rows4-5, cols0-1) \u2192 filled with 3,3.\n\n(3,2)=7 \u2192 mirrored to top right (rows0-1, cols4-5) \u2192 filled with7,7.\n\n(3,3)=8 \u2192 mirrored to top left (rows0-1, cols0-1) \u2192 filled with8,8.\n\nYes, that matches the output of example0. Let's check example1. The input's non-zero cells are in row1 columns1-2 (4,6), row2 columns1-2 (2,1). So the central 2x2 block is rows1-2, columns1-2. Wait, but in example1, the non-zero cells are:\n\nRow1: columns1-2:4,6.\n\nRow2: columns1-2:2,1.\n\nSo the central block is perhaps rows1-2, columns1-2. Applying the same mirroring logic:\n\nFor cell (1,1)=4 \u2192 which would be mirrored to bottom right (rows4-5, cols4-5). But in example1's output, the bottom right (cols4-5 in rows4-5) are 4,4. Yes, the output's rows4-5 cols4-5 are 4,4. So cell (1,1)=4 is mirrored to the bottom right.\n\nCell (1,2)=6 \u2192 mirrored to bottom left (rows4-5, cols0-1). In the output, rows4-5 cols0-1 have 6,6. Yes, example1's output's rows4-5 cols0-1 are 6s.\n\nCell (2,1)=2 \u2192 mirrored to top right (rows0-1 cols4-5). The output's top right (rows0-1 cols4-5) are 2,2. Yes, in example1's output row0, cols4-5 are 2,2. Row1's cols4-5 are 0,0. Wait, no. Wait example1's output's first row is [1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], which is row0. So cols4-5 are 2,2. So that's correct.\n\nCell (2,2)=1 \u2192 mirrored to top left (rows0-1 cols0-1). In the output's top left (rows0-1, cols0-1) are 1 and 0. Wait, row0's cols0-1 are 1,0? Wait example1's output row0 is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. So cols0 is1, col1 is0. That doesn't fit. Hmm. According to the pattern, cell (2,2) would be mirrored to the top left, but in example1's input, cell (2,2) is1. So the top left should have 1,1. But the output's top left (rows0-1, cols0-1) in example1's output is row0: [1,0], row1: [0,4]. Wait, that's not 1,1. So this contradicts the previous pattern.\n\nHmm. Maybe the central block isn't exactly 2x2. Or perhaps the mirroring is different. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn example1, the input has non-zero cells in rows1-2, columns1-2. So that's a 2x2 block. Then in the output, according to the previous example's pattern, each cell in the central block is mirrored to a corner. But in example1, cell (2,2) is1. According to the previous example's pattern, that should be mirrored to the top left. But in example1's output, the top left (rows0-1, cols0-1) is [1,0] and [0,4], which doesn't match. So perhaps my initial pattern assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is done based on the cell's position relative to the center. Let's think of the 6x6 grid as having a central area. The central 2x2 (rows 2-3, columns2-3) perhaps. Wait, in example0, the non-zero cells are in rows2-3, columns2-3. That's a 2x2 central block. Then the output's corners are created by mirroring the values from these central cells. So in example0, the central cells (2,2) is9, (2,3) is3, (3,2) is7, (3,3) is8. These are mirrored as follows:\n\n(2,2) \u2192 bottom right (rows4-5, cols4-5) \u2192 9,9.\n\n(2,3) \u2192 bottom left (rows4-5, cols0-1) \u21923,3.\n\n(3,2) \u2192 top right (rows0-1, cols4-5) \u21927,7.\n\n(3,3) \u2192 top left (rows0-1, cols0-1) \u21928,8.\n\nYes, that works for example0.\n\nIn example1, the non-zero cells are in rows1-2, columns1-2. So that's not the central 2x2. So perhaps the pattern is different. Wait, but example1's output has in the top left (rows0-1, cols0-1) a 1 and 0. Hmm. Maybe the central block is different.\n\nWait maybe the central block is determined as the minimal rectangle enclosing all non-zero cells. In example0, the non-zero cells are in rows2-3, columns2-3. So the central 2x2. In example1, the non-zero cells are rows1-2, columns1-2. So that's a 2x2 block but shifted up. Then, how does their mirroring work? Let's see example1's output:\n\nThe non-zero cells in the input are (1,1)=4, (1,2)=6, (2,1)=2, (2,2)=1.\n\nAccording to the previous pattern, each cell in this 2x2 block would be mirrored to the respective corners. For example:\n\n(1,1)=4 \u2192 mirrored to bottom right (rows4-5, cols4-5). In the output, rows4-5 cols4-5 are 0,0. But example1's output's rows4-5 are [0,0,0,0,0,0] in row5. Wait no, the output for example1:\n\nLooking back:\n\nExample1's output:\n\n[1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\n[0, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[6, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]\n\n[6, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo rows4-5, cols4-5 in example1's output have 4,4 in row4 and 0,0 in row5. Wait, maybe the mirroring is different here. Alternatively, maybe the central block is determined as the minimal enclosing rectangle, and the mirrored positions are determined based on their position relative to the center of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is done across the vertical and horizontal axes. For example, each cell (i,j) is mirrored to (5-i, j), (i,5-j), etc. But I need to check.\n\nIn example0, the cell (3,3) is 8. 5-3=2, so mirrored to (2,3), but that's in the original input. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: For each non-zero cell in the input, see where it appears in the output.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput non-zero cells:\n\n(2,2)9, (2,3)3, (3,2)7, (3,3)8.\n\nOutput:\n\nTop left (0-1,0-1) is8,8.\n\nTop right (0-1,4-5) is7,7.\n\nBottom left (4-5,0-1) is3,3.\n\nBottom right (4-5,4-5) is9,9.\n\nSo for each cell in the input's central 2x2:\n\n(2,2) \u2192 bottom right.\n\n(2,3) \u2192 bottom left.\n\n(3,2) \u2192 top right.\n\n(3,3) \u2192 top left.\n\nSo the mapping is based on their position within the central block. For example:\n\nIf the central block is (i,j) for i=2-3, j=2-3:\n\n- (2,2) \u2192 mirrored to (4,4).\n\nBut the output has 9 in the bottom right corner (rows4-5, cols4-5). So perhaps the value in (i,j) is placed in a corner block that's symmetric. For example, for cell (i,j) in the central block, the mirrored positions are:\n\nFor (2,2): bottom right.\n\nFor (2,3): bottom left.\n\nFor (3,2): top right.\n\nFor (3,3): top left.\n\nThe idea being that each cell's position (i,j) in the central 2x2 block is mirrored across both the horizontal and vertical midlines. So for example, (2,2) is in the top-left of the central block, so it's mirrored to the bottom-right corner. Similarly, (2,3) (top-right of central) \u2192 bottom-left corner. (3,2) (bottom-left of central) \u2192 top-right corner. (3,3) (bottom-right of central) \u2192 top-left corner.\n\nSo each cell's value is placed in a 2x2 block in the corresponding corner.\n\nIn example0:\n\n(3,3)=8 \u2192 top-left corner (0-1,0-1) filled with8.\n\n(3,2)=7 \u2192 top-right corner (0-1,4-5) filled with7.\n\n(2,3)=3 \u2192 bottom-left corner (4-5,0-1) filled with3.\n\n(2,2)=9 \u2192 bottom-right corner (4-5,4-5) filled with9.\n\nYes, this fits.\n\nNow check example1. The input's non-zero cells are in a 2x2 block at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). So their positions are:\n\n(1,1): top-left of the central block.\n\n(1,2): top-right.\n\n(2,1): bottom-left.\n\n(2,2): bottom-right of their 2x2 block.\n\nFollowing the same mirroring logic:\n\n(1,1) \u2192 bottom-right corner (rows4-5, cols4-5). The value here is4. So the output's bottom-right corner should be 4,4. Looking at example1's output:\n\nRow4: [6, 0, 0, 4,4,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo cols4-5 in row4 are4,4, and row5's cols4-5 are0,0. Hmm, but this seems like only part of the corner is filled. Or perhaps the mirroring is different when the central block is not the exact center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central block's position affects the mirrored corners. For example, if the central block is shifted up (rows1-2 instead of 2-3), then the mirrored corners would be adjusted. But this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the central block's position is determined as follows: it's the minimal rectangle containing all non-zero cells. Then, the four corners are mirrored based on their position within this rectangle.\n\nIn example1, the central block is rows1-2, cols1-2. So for each cell in this block:\n\n(1,1): top-left of the block \u2192 mirrored to bottom-right corner of the grid.\n\n(1,2): top-right \u2192 bottom-left.\n\n(2,1): bottom-left \u2192 top-right.\n\n(2,2): bottom-right \u2192 top-left.\n\nSo the values would be placed as follows:\n\n(1,1)=4 \u2192 bottom-right corner (rows4-5, cols4-5). In example1's output, rows4-5 cols4-5 are4,4 and 0,0. So row4's cols4-5 are4,4. So that matches.\n\n(1,2)=6 \u2192 bottom-left corner (rows4-5, cols0-1). Example1's output has rows4-5 cols0-1 as6,6 and0,0. So row4 cols0-1 are6,6.\n\n(2,1)=2 \u2192 top-right corner (rows0-1, cols4-5). Example1's output row0 cols4-5 are2,2. Row1 cols4-5 are0,0.\n\n(2,2)=1 \u2192 top-left corner (rows0-1, cols0-1). Example1's output row0 cols0-1 are1,0. Hmm, but that doesn't form a 2x2 block. Wait, row0 has [1,0], row1 has [0,4]. So it's 1 and 0 in row0 cols0-1, and 0 and4 in row1 cols0-1. That's different. So perhaps this pattern doesn't hold for example1. But maybe the mirroring depends on the position of the central block relative to the grid. For example, if the central block is closer to the top, then the mirrored positions are adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is done by reflecting the central block across the center of the grid. For example, if the central block is in rows1-2, then the mirrored positions would be rows3-4. But in example1, the output's rows4-5 cols0-1 have6,6, which could be mirrored from row1's cols1-2 (6 is at (1,2)).\n\nAlternatively, the mirroring is done vertically and horizontally. For example, the central block's cells are mirrored across the vertical and horizontal axes. So for a cell (i,j), the mirrored position is (5 - i, 5 - j). But let's test this.\n\nIn example0:\n\nCell (3,3) \u2192 mirrored to (2,2). But in example0's output, (3,3) is8, and the mirrored position (2,2) is9. That doesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the mirroring is done by flipping the central block's rows and columns. For example, if the central block is rows2-3, then mirrored rows would be 0-1 and4-5. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see example2's input and output.\n\nExample2's input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,6,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the non-zero cells are rows2-3, cols2-3 (3,6 in row2, 5,2 in row3). So central block is rows2-3, cols2-3.\n\nOutput:\n\nTop left (0-1,0-1) is2,2. Top right (0-1,4-5) is5,5. Bottom left (4-5,0-1) is6,6. Bottom right (4-5,4-5) is3,3.\n\nSo the cells:\n\n(2,2)=3 \u2192 bottom right (4-5,4-5) \u21923,3.\n\n(2,3)=6 \u2192 bottom left (4-5,0-1) \u21926,6.\n\n(3,2)=5 \u2192 top right (0-1,4-5) \u21925,5.\n\n(3,3)=2 \u2192 top left (0-1,0-1) \u21922,2.\n\nWhich fits the pattern from example0. So each cell in the central block is mirrored to a corner. The pattern is:\n\ncell (i,j) in the central block is mapped to:\n\n- if (i,j) is in the top-left of the central block (row2, col2), then to bottom-right corner.\n\n- top-right (row2, col3) \u2192 bottom-left.\n\n- bottom-left (row3, col2) \u2192 top-right.\n\n- bottom-right (row3, col3) \u2192 top-left.\n\nSo, for example0, the central block is rows2-3, cols2-3:\n\ncell (2,2) \u2192 bottom-right.\n\ncell (2,3) \u2192 bottom-left.\n\ncell (3,2) \u2192 top-right.\n\ncell (3,3) \u2192 top-left.\n\nThe same applies to example2. Now, example1's central block is rows1-2, cols1-2. Let's see:\n\ncell (1,1) \u2192 bottom-right (rows4-5, cols4-5) \u21924,4.\n\ncell (1,2) \u2192 bottom-left (rows4-5, cols0-1) \u21926,6.\n\ncell (2,1) \u2192 top-right (rows0-1, cols4-5) \u21922,2.\n\ncell (2,2) \u2192 top-left (rows0-1, cols0-1) \u21921,1.\n\nBut in example1's output, the top-left corner (rows0-1, cols0-1) is row0: [1,0], row1: [0,4]. That's not 1,1. So the pattern breaks here. Wait, but in example1's output, the top-left corner has 1 in row0, col0. Perhaps there's another rule. Maybe the mirrored value is placed in the first occurrence of the corresponding corner, but only in the top rows. But in example1's case, the cell (2,2)=1 is supposed to be mirrored to the top-left corner. But the output has a 1 in row0, col0. Then the rest of the top-left corner (rows0-1, cols0-1) has 1 and0. Not sure why.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern applies only when the central block is exactly in the middle of the grid. In example0 and example2, the central block is rows2-3, cols2-3, which is the exact center of a 6x6 grid. So for those, the mirroring to corners works perfectly. But example1's central block is not centered, so the mirroring rules are different. But this complicates the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central block is considered to be the 2x2 in the exact center (rows2-3, cols2-3), and any non-zero cells outside this are ignored. But that doesn't fit example1, where the non-zero cells are outside the central 2x2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the 2x2 block in the exact center is used to generate the corners, regardless of where the non-zero cells are. But example1's input has no non-zero cells in the central 2x2. Wait, example1's input has non-zero cells at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). So in a 6x6 grid, rows1-2, cols1-2. The exact center 2x2 is rows2-3, cols2-3. So example1's non-zero cells are in the rows1-2, which are above the center. So in that case, how does the output get generated?\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent, but the examples show that the central 2x2 is the only one generating the corners. But example1's output has corners filled even though the non-zero cells are not in the central 2x2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the 2x2 block starting from the first occurrence of non-zero rows and columns. But that might vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is: identify the 2x2 block of non-zero numbers closest to the center. For example, in example1, the non-zero cells are in rows1-2, cols1-2. But the center of the grid is rows2-3, cols2-3. So maybe the closest 2x2 block is rows1-2, cols1-2. Then mirror those cells to the corners according to their position within that block. For example:\n\ncell (1,1) (top-left of the block) \u2192 bottom-right corner.\n\ncell (1,2) (top-right) \u2192 bottom-left.\n\ncell (2,1) (bottom-left) \u2192 top-right.\n\ncell (2,2) (bottom-right) \u2192 top-left.\n\nSo in example1:\n\ncell (1,1)=4 \u2192 bottom-right (rows4-5, cols4-5). In example1's output, rows4-5 cols4-5 are 4,4 (row4) and 0,0 (row5). So row4 has 4,4.\n\ncell (1,2)=6 \u2192 bottom-left (rows4-5, cols0-1). Example1's output rows4-5 cols0-1 are6,6 (row4) and0,0 (row5).\n\ncell (2,1)=2 \u2192 top-right (rows0-1, cols4-5). Example1's output rows0-1 cols4-5 are 2,2 (row0) and0,0 (row1).\n\ncell (2,2)=1 \u2192 top-left (rows0-1, cols0-1). Example1's output rows0-1 cols0-1 are1 and0 (row0), and0 and4 (row1). Hmm, this part doesn't fit. The top-left corner should have1,1, but instead there's a1 in row0 col0, and row1 col0 is0. So maybe this cell's value is placed in the first row of the corner.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the top-left corner is filled with the cell's value in the first row and first column, but the rest is filled with zeros. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is done in a way that each cell's value is placed in the corresponding corner's 2x2 block, but overlapping occurs when the central block is not centered. For example, in example1, the central block is rows1-2, cols1-2. So the top-left corner (rows0-1, cols0-1) would be filled with the value from cell (2,2)=1. But in example1's output, only row0 col0 is1, and the rest are zeros. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is done in a way that each cell's value is placed in the same position relative to the corner. For example, the cell (i,j) in the central block is mirrored to (i', j') in the corner, where i' and j' are determined based on the position within the central block. For example, in a central block starting at row x, column y, the cell (x, y) would map to the bottom-right corner's top-left cell. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the values from the central block are mirrored to the corners, but in the case where the central block is not in the exact center, the mirrored corners are adjusted. For example, if the central block is rows1-2, cols1-2, then the mirrored corners are:\n\ntop-left: rows0-1, cols0-1.\n\ntop-right: rows0-1, cols4-5.\n\nbottom-left: rows4-5, cols0-1.\n\nbottom-right: rows4-5, cols4-5.\n\nBut how does the value placement happen?\n\nIn example1, the central block is rows1-2, cols1-2. So:\n\ncell (1,1)=4 \u2192 bottom-right (rows4-5, cols4-5). So the 4 is placed in the bottom-right corner's 2x2 block. Which is rows4-5, cols4-5. In example1's output, these positions have 4,4 in row4, cols4-5. Row5's cols4-5 are0.\n\ncell (1,2)=6 \u2192 bottom-left (rows4-5, cols0-1). In the output, rows4-5 cols0-1 have6,6 (row4) and0,0 (row5).\n\ncell (2,1)=2 \u2192 top-right (rows0-1, cols4-5). Output's row0 cols4-5 are2,2. Row1's cols4-5 are0,0.\n\ncell (2,2)=1 \u2192 top-left (rows0-1, cols0-1). Output's row0 cols0-1 have1 and0. Row1's cols0-1 have0 and4.\n\nSo in the top-left corner, the cell (2,2)=1 is placed in row0, col0. But then the row1, col0 is0, and col1 is4. The 4 comes from cell (1,1)=4. But according to the mirroring pattern, cell (1,1)=4 should be in the bottom-right corner, which it is. So why is there a4 in row1, col1 of the output? Because row1, col1 is part of the original input's central block, which is preserved in the output. Looking at example1's output, rows1-2, cols1-2 are the same as the input:4,6 and2,1. So the original non-zero cells are preserved in the output, and the mirrored values are added in the corners.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- Preserve the original non-zero cells.\n\n- For each cell in the central 2x2 block (determined by the positions of the non-zero cells?), mirror their values to the four corners as 2x2 blocks.\n\nBut in example1, the central block is rows1-2, cols1-2, and the mirrored values are placed in the corners as 2x2 blocks. However, in the output, the top-left corner's 2x2 block has 1 in (0,0) and 0s elsewhere. Why?\n\nAh, perhaps the 2x2 blocks in the corners are filled with the mirrored value, but only if there's space. For example, if the mirrored corner is close to the edge, then the 2x2 block may overlap with existing non-zero cells. But in example1's top-left corner, the output's row0, col0 is1, and row1, col0 is0, row0, col1 is0, row1, col1 is4. So the 1 is only in row0, col0, and the rest of the top-left 2x2 block is zeros and the preserved 4 from the input.\n\nThis suggests that the mirroring process places the value in the top-left cell of the corner's 2x2 block, but the other cells are left as is. But this seems inconsistent with the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirrored values are placed in the corners as 2x2 blocks, but if the corner's 2x2 block overlaps with existing non-zero cells (from the input), those are overwritten. But in example1's output, the top-left corner has 1 in row0, col0 and 4 in row1, col1 (which is from the input). So the 4 is preserved. So the mirroring process must only affect the corner's 2x2 block and not overwrite existing non-zero cells.\n\nThis makes the pattern more complex. But perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For each cell in the central 2x2 block (determined by the non-zero cells), mirror their values to the corresponding corner's 2x2 block, filling those cells if they are zero. If they are non-zero in the input, they are preserved.\n\nBut in example1's input, the central block's cells are all non-zero, and their mirrored positions in the corners are zero, so they are filled. But in the top-left corner, the cell (0,0) was zero in the input, so it's filled with1. But (0,1) was zero and filled with0? No, example1's output row0 is [1,0,0,2,2,0]. So (0,0)=1, (0,1)=0. But according to the mirroring rule, the entire 2x2 block should be filled with1s. So this suggests that the pattern isn't followed here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirrored values are placed in the corners only if the corresponding cells in the input are zero. So for example, in example1's top-left corner, the cells (0,0) and (0,1) are zero, so they are filled with1 and0 (but where does the0 come from?), while (1,0) and (1,1) are already non-zero (from the input's row1, col0=0 and col1=4). So (1,0) is zero in the input, so it's filled with0. But how?\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for other patterns. In example0's output, the top-left 2x2 blocks (rows0-1, cols0-1) are all8. The top-right 2x2 are all7. Bottom-left 3s, bottom-right9s. So the mirrored values are placed in 2x2 blocks.\n\nExample1's output has in the top-left corner (row0, cols0-1) [1,0], row1 is [0,4]. So it's not a uniform block. The top-right has row0 cols4-5 as2,2. Bottom-left rows4-5 cols0-1 as6,6. Bottom-right rows4-5 cols4-5 as4,4.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the mirrored values are placed in the first two rows (for top corners) and last two rows (for bottom corners). For example, in example1:\n\n- cell (2,2)=1 \u2192 top-left, so the first two rows, first two cols. But in the output, only row0 col0 is1. The rest are either preserved or filled with zeros.\n\nAlternatively, the mirrored value is placed in the same row and column relative to the corner. For example, if the cell is in position (i,j) of the central block, then the mirrored corner's cell is (i % 2, j % 2). For example, cell (1,1) (which is odd row and column) would map to (1,1) in the bottom-right corner. But in example1's output, the bottom-right corner's (4,4) and (4,5) are4,4, but row4, col4-5 are4,4, which is correct for cell (1,1)=4.\n\nCell (1,2)=6 \u2192 (1,2) in the central block. The mirrored corner is bottom-left. So (1,2) would map to (1,0) in the bottom-left's 2x2 block. So rows4-5 cols0-1. In example1's output, row4 cols0-1 are6,6. So (4,0) and (4,1)=6. Which fits.\n\nCell (2,1)=2 \u2192 in the central block. Mirrored to top-right. The position (2,1) maps to (0,4) and (0,5). So row0 cols4-5=2,2. Which is correct.\n\nCell (2,2)=1 \u2192 mirrored to top-left. Position (0,0) and (0,1). So row0 col0=1, col1=0. But why is col1=0? Maybe because the original cell's position (2,2) is even row and even column, so mapped to (0,0). But the other cells in the 2x2 block are zero. So perhaps only the cell corresponding to the mirrored position is filled, and others are left as zero.\n\nSo the pattern could be: each cell (i,j) in the central block is mirrored to (i % 2, j % 2) in the corresponding corner's 2x2 block. For example:\n\nIn example0, the central block is rows2-3, cols2-3.\n\ncell (2,2)=9 \u2192 bottom-right corner's 2x2 block (rows4-5, cols4-5). The mirrored position would be (2%2=0, 2%2=0) \u2192 (4,4). But the entire 2x2 block is filled with9. So perhaps the entire block is filled with the value.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in the central block, the corresponding 2x2 block in the corner is filled with that cell's value. So the entire 2x2 block in the corner is filled with the mirrored cell's value.\n\nIn example0:\n\ncell (3,3)=8 \u2192 top-left corner's 2x2 block filled with8.\n\ncell (3,2)=7 \u2192 top-right filled with7.\n\ncell (2,3)=3 \u2192 bottom-left filled with3.\n\ncell (2,2)=9 \u2192 bottom-right filled with9.\n\nIn example1:\n\ncell (2,2)=1 \u2192 top-left corner's 2x2 block filled with1.\n\ncell (2,1)=2 \u2192 top-right filled with2.\n\ncell (1,2)=6 \u2192 bottom-left filled with6.\n\ncell (1,1)=4 \u2192 bottom-right filled with4.\n\nBut example1's output shows that the top-left corner's 2x2 block has [1,0] in row0 and [0,4] in row1. This doesn't fit, as it should be filled with1s. However, the row1, col1 is4, which is the original value from the input. So perhaps the mirrored values are placed only in the zero cells of the output. So the existing non-zero cells from the input are preserved, and the mirrored values are filled in the zero cells of the corners.\n\nIn example1's input, the top-left corner's 2x2 block (rows0-1, cols0-1) are all zeros. So the mirrored values (1) would fill that block. But in example1's output, only row0, col0 is1. The others are zero. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirrored values are placed in the corners but only in the first or last two rows/columns. For example, in example1, the top-left corner's 2x2 block is rows0-1, cols0-1. The value is1, so the first two rows and first two columns of the output are filled with1. But in the output, only row0 col0 is1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look for the pattern that fits all examples. Let's try to derive the rule:\n\nFor each example, the output adds 2x2 blocks in the four corners. The values in these blocks are derived from the central 2x2 block of non-zero cells in the input. The mapping is as follows:\n\n- The cell in the bottom-right of the central block (highest row and column indices) becomes the top-left corner block.\n\n- The cell in the bottom-left of the central block (highest row, lowest column) becomes the top-right corner block.\n\n- The cell in the top-right of the central block (lowest row, highest column) becomes the bottom-left corner block.\n\n- The cell in the top-left of the central block (lowest row and column) becomes the bottom-right corner block.\n\nThen, each corner block is filled with the corresponding value in a 2x2 pattern.\n\nSo for example0:\n\nCentral block cells (from top-left to bottom-right):\n\n(2,2)=9 (top-left of central),\n\n(2,3)=3 (top-right),\n\n(3,2)=7 (bottom-left),\n\n(3,3)=8 (bottom-right).\n\nSo the mapping is:\n\nbottom-right of central (8) \u2192 top-left corner.\n\nbottom-left of central (7) \u2192 top-right corner.\n\ntop-right of central (3) \u2192 bottom-left corner.\n\ntop-left of central (9) \u2192 bottom-right corner.\n\nThen each corner block is filled with the corresponding value in 2x2.\n\nYes, example0's output matches this.\n\nExample2's input central block:\n\ncells (2,2)=3 (top-left of central),\n\n(2,3)=6 (top-right),\n\n(3,2)=5 (bottom-left),\n\n(3,3)=2 (bottom-right).\n\nMapping:\n\nbottom-right (2) \u2192 top-left corner (2,2 in output's top-left).\n\nbottom-left (5) \u2192 top-right corner.\n\ntop-right (6) \u2192 bottom-left corner.\n\ntop-left (3) \u2192 bottom-right corner.\n\nWhich matches example2's output.\n\nExample1's central block is rows1-2, cols1-2. The cells are:\n\n(1,1)=4 (top-left of central),\n\n(1,2)=6 (top-right),\n\n(2,1)=2 (bottom-left),\n\n(2,2)=1 (bottom-right).\n\nMapping:\n\nbottom-right of central (1) \u2192 top-left corner.\n\nbottom-left (2) \u2192 top-right.\n\ntop-right (6) \u2192 bottom-left.\n\ntop-left (4) \u2192 bottom-right.\n\nSo in example1's output:\n\ntop-left corner should be filled with1. But the output's top-left is [1,0,0,4] in rows0-1, cols0-1. Which is not a uniform block. However, in the output, the top-right has2,2 (row0 cols4-5), bottom-left has6,6 (row4-5 cols0-1), and bottom-right has4,4 (row4-5 cols4-5). So this fits.\n\nThe top-left corner's 2x2 block is rows0-1, cols0-1. According to the pattern, it should be filled with1 (from the bottom-right cell of the central block). But in example1's output, only row0 col0 is1. The rest are zeros or the original values. So perhaps in cases where the central block is not centered, the mirroring only affects the first row or column of the corner blocks.\n\nBut why does example1's top-left have only row0 col0 filled with1? Maybe because the bottom-right cell of the central block (2,2) is1, and the top-left corner's first cell (0,0) is filled with1, but the other cells in the corner's 2x2 are filled with zeros because they are outside the central block's mirrored area. This seems inconsistent, but perhaps the rule is that the value is placed in the top-left cell of the corner's 2x2 block and the rest are filled with zeros.\n\nBut how does that fit with other examples?\n\nIn example0, the top-left corner's 2x2 block is filled with8,8. Which is the value from the bottom-right cell of the central block (3,3)=8. So the entire block is filled. But in example1, only one cell is filled. This inconsistency suggests that the pattern might depend on the central block's position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of rows between the central block and the top of the grid determines how many rows are filled. For example, in example0, the central block starts at row2, which is two rows away from the top. So the top-left corner's 2x2 block can be filled. In example1, the central block starts at row1, which is closer to the top. So the top-left corner's 2x2 block can only fill one row (rows0-1) and the rest are filled with zeros.\n\nBut this complicates the pattern. Given the time I have, perhaps the best approach is to apply the pattern observed in example0 and example2 to the test input.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe non-zero cells are in rows3-4, cols2-3. So the central block is rows3-4, cols2-3. \n\nThe cells are:\n\n(3,2)=3, (3,3)=1,\n\n(4,2)=2, (4,3)=5.\n\nSo the central block's cells:\n\nTop-left of the central block is (3,2)=3.\n\nTop-right is (3,3)=1.\n\nBottom-left is (4,2)=2.\n\nBottom-right is (4,3)=5.\n\nAccording to the pattern from example0 and example2:\n\n- bottom-right cell (4,3)=5 \u2192 top-left corner's 2x2 block filled with5.\n\n- bottom-left cell (4,2)=2 \u2192 top-right corner's 2x2 block filled with2.\n\n- top-right cell (3,3)=1 \u2192 bottom-left corner's 2x2 block filled with1.\n\n- top-left cell (3,2)=3 \u2192 bottom-right corner's 2x2 block filled with3.\n\nThen, the output would have:\n\nTop-left (rows0-1, cols0-1):5,5.\n\nTop-right (rows0-1, cols4-5):2,2.\n\nBottom-left (rows4-5, cols0-1):1,1.\n\nBottom-right (rows4-5, cols4-5):3,3.\n\nAdditionally, the original non-zero cells are preserved.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRows0-1:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRows2: all zeros.\n\nRows3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRows4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nRows5: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the bottom-left corner is rows4-5, cols0-1. The current rows4 and5:\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo after adding the bottom-left corner's 1,1:\n\nRow4 cols0-1:1,1.\n\nRow5 cols0-1:1,1.\n\nBut the original row4 has [0,0,2,5,0,0]. So cols0-1 become1,1.\n\nSimilarly, bottom-right corner (rows4-5, cols4-5):\n\nRow4 cols4-5 become3,3.\n\nRow5 cols4-5 become3,3.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\nRow0: [5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow1: [5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,1,2,5,3,3]\n\nRow5: [1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut wait, in row4, cols0-1 are1,1, but cols2-3 are2,5 (from the input). So that's correct.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[1,1,2,5,3,3]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output always preserves the original non-zero cells and adds the mirrored 2x2 blocks in the corners. So the test input's output should follow this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input grids are transformed into the output grids. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a 9 and 3 in the third row, and 7 and 8 in the fourth row. The output has 8s and 7s in the first two rows, and 3s and 9s in the last two. Hmm. Wait, maybe the numbers are being mirrored or rotated. Let's check the positions. The original numbers are in the middle two rows. The output has numbers added in the top and bottom rows. For instance, the top rows have 8s and 7s. The bottom rows have 3s and 9s. Looking at the original numbers: 9,3 and 7,8. The output top has 8 and 7, which are the numbers from the fourth row reversed (7,8 becomes 8,7?) Maybe. And the bottom of the output has 3 and 9, which could be from the third row's 9,3 reversed. So perhaps the surrounding rows are taking the values from the middle rows, flipping them, and placing them in pairs. Also, the numbers in the output's top and bottom are duplicated in pairs. Like 8,8 and 7,7. Similarly, 3,3 and 9,9. So each value is repeated twice, forming a block. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has 4,6 and 2,1 in rows 2 and 3. The output's first row has 1, followed by 0s, then 2,2. Then in the third and fourth rows, there's 6,0,0,4,4. Wait, maybe the pattern is that the numbers from the middle rows are being moved to the outer rows, perhaps mirrored. For instance, the 4,6 and 2,1 in the input. The output's first row starts with 1, which is from the 2,1's 1. The 6 and 4 in the output's fourth and fifth rows. So perhaps the numbers from the middle rows are split into their components and placed in the outer rows, flipped or rotated. Also, the numbers are duplicated in pairs. For example, 2,2 in the first row's end, which might correspond to the 2 in the input's third row. \n\nAnother observation: in each example, the non-zero numbers in the input are in the central rows. The output then creates \"blocks\" of these numbers in the top and bottom rows, possibly mirrored. For instance, in Example 0, the 7 and 8 in the fourth row become 8 and 7 in the top rows, each repeated twice. Similarly, the 9 and 3 become 3 and 9 in the bottom rows. So it's like taking the middle rows, reversing their non-zero pairs, and placing them in the top and bottom with duplication. But how exactly?\n\nWait, maybe each pair in the middle rows is split into two parts. For example, in Example 0, the third row is [9,3], and the fourth is [7,8]. The output's top two rows have 8,8, then 7,7. The bottom two rows have 3,3 and 9,9. So it's as if the fourth row's entries are reversed (7,8 becomes 8,7) and placed in the top, each duplicated. The third row's entries are reversed (9,3 becomes 3,9) and placed in the bottom, duplicated. So the pattern is: take the two central rows, reverse each pair, and place them in the outer rows (top and bottom), each number duplicated in pairs, and zeros in between. \n\nLet's check Example 1. The input has in row 2 (0-based?) Let me count the rows. Assuming rows are 0 to 5. In Example 1's input, the non-zero entries are in row 1: [4,6], row 2: [2,1]. Then the output's first row (row 0) starts with 1, which is the last number of row 2's pair (2,1 -> 1,2?), maybe. Then there are 2,2. Wait, the output row 0 is [1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]. So 1 and then 2,2. So perhaps the numbers from the middle rows are split into individual elements, reversed, and placed in the outer rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two middle rows are considered as a 2x2 block. For Example 0, the third and fourth rows (indices 2 and 3) have:\n\n9 3\n\n7 8\n\nThis forms a 2x2 block. The output's top rows have 8 and 7, which are the elements from the fourth row (7,8) reversed to 8,7. The bottom rows have 3 and 9, which are the third row's elements (9,3) reversed. Then these reversed pairs are split into the top and bottom, each number duplicated twice. So in the output, the top two rows are filled with 8,8 followed by 7,7. The bottom two rows have 3,3 followed by 9,9. So each element of the reversed pair is duplicated in adjacent cells. Similarly, the middle rows remain the same.\n\nIn Example 1, the middle rows (rows 1 and 2) have:\n\n4 6\n\n2 1\n\nSo the 2x2 block here. Reversed rows? So the first row (4,6) and second row (2,1) would form a 2x2 matrix. If we take the elements from the second row first (2,1) and then the first row (4,6), but reversed. Wait, perhaps the block is transposed or rotated. Let's think. For example, the 2x2 block in Example 0 is:\n\n9 3\n\n7 8\n\nIf we take the elements as a list [9,3,7,8], maybe the output uses the elements in reverse order? Like 8,7,3,9. Then arrange them in the outer rows. But the output's top rows have 8,8, 0,0,7,7. So two 8s, two 7s. And the bottom has 3s and 9s. So maybe the elements are split into pairs. For Example 0's 2x2 block, the elements are 9,3,7,8. Reversed as 8,7,3,9. Then each pair (8 and 7, then 3 and 9) is placed in the top and bottom, duplicated. \n\nSimilarly, Example 1's 2x2 block is 4,6,2,1. Reversed as 1,2,6,4. Then split into two pairs: (1,2) and (6,4). The top would take the first reversed pair (1,2), and the bottom takes (6,4). But in Example 1's output, the first row has [1,0,0,2,2,0]. So the 1 is in the first position, then 2s at positions 3 and 4. That doesn't align with a simple split. Maybe the top takes the first element (1) and the third element (6), and the bottom takes the second (2) and fourth (4). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outer rows (top and bottom) are filled with the reversed pairs, but arranged in a certain way. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the top two rows have 8s followed by 7s, and the bottom two have 3s followed by 9s. So the reversed pairs are 8,7 (from the original fourth row's 7,8) and 3,9 (from the third row's 9,3). Each of these pairs is split into two parts. The 8,7 becomes two 8s and two 7s. The 3,9 becomes two 3s and two 9s. \n\nWait, perhaps each of the original pairs is reversed and then each element is duplicated in the outer rows. For example, in Example 0, the fourth row has 7,8. Reverse to 8,7. Each element becomes two copies. So 8,8 followed by 7,7. Similarly, third row's 9,3 becomes 3,9, leading to 3,3 and 9,9. So the top rows take the reversed pairs from the lower middle row, and the bottom rows take the reversed pairs from the upper middle row.\n\nIn Example 1, the middle rows are row 1 (4,6) and row 2 (2,1). So the lower middle row here is row 2 (2,1). Reverse to 1,2. Then split into 1 and 2, each duplicated. So in the top rows, we have 1 followed by 2,2. But in the output's first row, it's [1,0,0,2,2,0]. The top two rows have 1 and then 2,2. But how is this arranged? Maybe the reversed pairs are placed in the top and bottom, starting from the left for the top and right for the bottom. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each original middle pair is split into two numbers, and each is placed in opposite ends of the outer rows. For example, in Example 0, the reversed lower middle pair (8,7) is placed on the left and right of the top rows, each duplicated. So 8,8 on the left and 7,7 on the right. Similarly, the reversed upper middle pair (3,9) is placed on the left (3,3) and right (9,9) of the bottom rows. \n\nLet's check Example 2. The input's middle rows (rows 2 and 3) have 3,6 and 5,2. Reversed lower middle (5,2 becomes 2,5), reversed upper middle (3,6 becomes 6,3). The output's top rows have 2,2 followed by 5,5. The bottom rows have 6,6 followed by 3,3. So that fits the pattern. The reversed lower middle pair (2,5) becomes 2,2 and 5,5 on top. The reversed upper middle pair (6,3) becomes 6,6 and 3,3 on the bottom. So each reversed pair's elements are split into left and right, each duplicated twice, in the outer rows.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Identify the two middle rows (rows 2 and 3 in a 6-row grid) that have non-zero elements. These form two pairs.\n\n2. For each of these two rows, reverse the order of the non-zero elements.\n\n3. For the lower middle row (row 3), after reversing, split the two elements and place them in the top two rows: first element duplicated on the left, second element duplicated on the right.\n\n4. For the upper middle row (row 2), after reversing, split the two elements and place them in the bottom two rows: first element duplicated on the left, second element duplicated on the right.\n\n5. The original middle rows (rows 2 and 3) remain unchanged in the output.\n\nLet's verify this with Example 1. The middle rows (rows 1 and 2 in Example 1's input, but wait, the input in Example 1 has non-zero in rows 1, 2. Wait, rows are 0-based. So the original input in Example 1:\n\nRow 0: all zeros\n\nRow 1: [0,4,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: all zeros\n\nRows 4 and 5: zeros.\n\nWait, this complicates things. Because in the other examples, the non-zero rows are in the middle (rows 2 and 3). But here, in Example 1, the non-zero rows are rows 1 and 2. Hmm. So perhaps the middle two rows are considered as the two consecutive rows that have non-zero elements. In Example 0, rows 2 and 3. In Example 1, rows 1 and 2. So the pattern applies to the two consecutive non-zero rows, wherever they are. Then the reversed pairs are taken from those rows. \n\nIn Example 1, the two non-zero rows are row 1 and row 2. The lower of these two is row 2 (since row 1 is higher than row 2?), wait no, row indices increase from top to bottom. So row 1 is above row 2. So in Example 1, the two consecutive non-zero rows are 1 and 2. The lower middle row here is row 2 (row index 2). The upper is row 1. \n\nWait, but according to the previous pattern, the lower middle row's reversed pair is placed in the top rows, and the upper's reversed pair is placed in the bottom rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the lower middle row (row 2) has [0,2,1,0,0,0]. The non-zero elements are 2 and 1. So reversed to 1,2. Then split into left (1) and right (2). Each duplicated. So the top rows (0 and 1) would have 1 on the left and 2 on the right. But looking at the output of Example 1:\n\nOutput row 0: [1,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,4,6,0,0,0]\n\nSo the top row (row 0) has 1 followed by zeros, then 2,2. So the left part is 1 (only one occurrence?), but according to previous examples, perhaps the top two rows are filled with the duplicated elements. Wait, in Example 1's output, the first row (row 0) has [1,0,0,2,2,0]. The second row (row 1) is the original row 1. The third and fourth rows (row 2 and 3) have [0,2,1,0,0,0] and then the original row 3 (zeros). Then rows 4 and 5 have [6,0,0,4,4,0] and [6,0,0,4,4,0]. \n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the bottom two rows (rows 4 and 5) have 6,6 on the left and 4,4 on the right. So the reversed upper middle row (row 1's non-zero elements: 4,6. Reversed to 6,4. Split into left (6) and right (4), each duplicated. So the bottom rows (4 and 5) have 6,6 followed by 4,4. \n\nSo the pattern holds here. The lower middle row's reversed pair (row 2's 2,1 reversed to 1,2) is placed in the top rows (row 0 and 1?), but in the output, row 0 has 1 and 2,2. Row 1 is the original row 1. So maybe the top rows are the first two rows (rows 0 and 1), but in Example 0, the top rows (0 and 1) are filled with the reversed lower middle pair. However, in Example 1, the original row 1 is part of the middle rows, so the top rows (0 and 1) can't be filled with the reversed pair. So perhaps the top rows are the first available rows above the middle rows, and the bottom rows are the first available rows below. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output splits the grid into four quadrants. Wait, but the examples don't align with that. \n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the two middle rows (regardless of their position) are the ones with non-zero elements. For each of these two rows, reverse their non-zero elements. Then, the lower row's reversed elements go to the top of the grid, duplicated in pairs. The upper row's reversed elements go to the bottom of the grid, duplicated in pairs. \n\nIn Example 0, the lower middle row is row 3 (since rows 2 and 3 are the middle rows), reversed to 8,7 (from 7,8). So placed in the top rows (0 and 1) as 8,8 and 7,7. The upper middle row (row 2) has 9,3 reversed to 3,9, placed in the bottom rows (4 and 5) as 3,3 and 9,9. \n\nIn Example 1, the lower middle row is row 2 (since rows 1 and 2 are the middle rows here), reversed elements 1,2 (from 2,1). These are placed in the top rows (0 and 1), but row 1 is part of the original middle rows. Wait, in Example 1's output, the top row (row 0) has [1,0,0,2,2,0], and row 1 is the original row 1. So perhaps the lower middle row's reversed elements are placed in the first available top rows (row 0 in this case, since row 1 is occupied by the original data). But then how to structure the duplication. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the top rows are filled from the top, starting at the first row (row 0), and the bottom rows are filled from the bottom (row 5 upwards). \n\nLet me think again. For the lower middle row's reversed elements, in Example 0, they are placed in rows 0 and 1. For Example 1, reversed elements from lower middle row (row 2's 1,2) are placed in row 0 and possibly row 1. But row 1 has existing data. So maybe the top rows are the first two rows (0 and 1) regardless, but if those rows already have data, they are overwritten? But in Example 1's output, row 1 is the original row 1's data. So perhaps the top rows (0 and 1) are filled with the reversed lower middle pair, but existing non-zero data is left as is. Hmm, but that complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are structured such that the original middle rows (the two that had non-zero) are kept, and the reversed pairs are placed in the first two available rows above and below. \n\nWait, in Example 1, the reversed lower middle row (row 2's 1,2) would be placed in rows 0 and 1. But row 1 is part of the middle rows, so perhaps only row 0 is used. But in the output, row 0 has the 1 and 2,2. Maybe each reversed pair's elements are placed in the top and bottom, each taking two rows. For example, the first element of the reversed lower pair is placed in the first two rows' left side, duplicated, and the second element in the first two rows' right side, duplicated. Similarly for the reversed upper pair in the bottom two rows.\n\nIn Example 1, reversed lower pair (1,2) would have 1 duplicated on the left (positions 0-1) of rows 0 and 1. But in the output, row 0 has 1 in position 0, then zeros, then 2,2 in positions 3-4. So perhaps it's split into left and right, with each element taking two columns. So for 1,2: left two columns (0-1) for 1, and right two columns (4-5) for 2. But in the output, row 0 has 1 in column 0, then zeros, then 2 in columns 3-4. Hmm, maybe it's placed starting from column 0 and then column 3, but duplicated twice. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to outline a general rule:\n\n- Identify the two consecutive middle rows with non-zero elements. Let's call them row A (upper) and row B (lower).\n\n- For row B (lower), reverse the non-zero elements. Split into two elements. Place the first element in the top two rows (rows 0 and 1) on the left side (columns 0-1), duplicated. Place the second element in the top two rows on the right side (columns 4-5), duplicated.\n\n- For row A (upper), reverse the non-zero elements. Split into two elements. Place the first element in the bottom two rows (rows 4 and 5) on the left side, duplicated. Place the second element in the bottom two rows on the right side, duplicated.\n\nBut let's check with Example 0. Row B (row 3) has elements 7,8. Reversed to 8,7. Top two rows (0-1) have 8,8 in columns 0-1 and 7,7 in columns 4-5. Which matches. Row A (row 2) has 9,3 \u2192 reversed to 3,9. Bottom rows (4-5) have 3,3 in columns 0-1 and 9,9 in columns 4-5. Correct.\n\nExample 2: row B (row 3) has 5,2 \u2192 reversed to 2,5. Top rows 0-1 have 2,2 and 5,5. Row A (row 2) has 3,6 \u2192 reversed to 6,3. Bottom rows 4-5 have 6,6 and 3,3. Correct.\n\nExample 1: row B (row 2) has 2,1 \u2192 reversed to 1,2. So top rows should have 1,1 on left and 2,2 on right. But in the output, row 0 has [1,0,0,2,2,0]. So columns 0 is 1, columns 3-4 are 2,2. Hmm, not exactly leftmost two columns. Maybe the left and right are the first two and last two columns. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, left two columns (0-1) and right two columns (4-5). Correct.\n\nIn Example 1's output row 0: 1 is in column 0, and 2,2 are in columns 3-4. So perhaps it's columns 0-1 and 4-5. But in Example 1, it's [1,0,0,2,2,0]. So 1 is in 0, but 2,2 start at 3. Hmm. Maybe the split is into columns 0-1 and 3-4? Or maybe it's columns 0-1 for left and 4-5 for right, but in Example 1, the middle rows' elements are in columns 1-2, so the reversed elements are placed in columns 0-1 (left) and 3-4 (right), leaving column 5 as zero. \n\nThis suggests that the reversed elements are placed in the first two available columns (leftmost) and then the next available columns to the right. But this might vary. Alternatively, maybe the non-zero elements in the original middle rows are in columns that are mirrored. For example, in Example 0, the non-zero elements in row B (row 3) are columns 2-3 (7,8). Reversed to 8,7. These are placed in columns 0-1 and 4-5. So the positions are mirrored. Original columns 2-3 \u2192 mirrored to 0-1 and 4-5. \n\nYes! Because in a 6-column grid, columns 0-1 are the leftmost two, and columns 4-5 are the rightmost two. The original non-zero elements in columns 2-3 are mirrored to the outer columns. So for each reversed pair in the middle rows, the elements are placed in the left two columns (0-1) and right two columns (4-5) of the top and bottom rows. \n\nLet's verify this:\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow B (row 3) has 7,8 in columns 2-3. Reversed to 8,7. Placed in top rows 0-1, left columns 0-1 (8,8) and right columns 4-5 (7,7).\n\nRow A (row 2) has 9,3 in columns 2-3. Reversed to 3,9. Placed in bottom rows 4-5, left columns 0-1 (3,3) and right columns 4-5 (9,9).\n\nExample 2:\n\nRow B (row 3) has 5,2 in columns 2-3. Reversed to 2,5. Top rows 0-1 left 2,2 and right 5,5.\n\nRow A (row 2) has 3,6 in columns 2-3. Reversed to 6,3. Bottom rows 4-5 left 6,6 and right 3,3.\n\nExample 1:\n\nRow B (row 2) has 2,1 in columns 1-2 (original row 2: [0,2,1,0,0,0]). Columns 1-2. Reversed to 1,2. So mirrored to left columns 0-1 and right columns 4-5. But in the output row 0: [1,0,0,2,2,0]. So the 1 is in column 0, and the 2,2 are in columns 3-4. Hmm, columns 3-4 are not the rightmost two. Wait, perhaps the mirroring is around the center. For example, columns 2-3 are the middle. So mirroring columns 1-2 would be to columns 4-3 (but that's not possible). Alternatively, perhaps the positions are mirrored such that the original columns (c) are mapped to (5 - c). For example, original column 2 would map to 5-2=3. Original column 1 would map to 4. So for row B (row 2) in Example 1, the elements are in columns 1 and 2. Mirroring would place them in columns 4 and 3. So reversed elements 1 and 2 would be placed in columns 4 and 3. But in the output, row 0 has 2,2 starting at column 3. That aligns with this. So 1 is placed in column 4 and 3? No, wait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirrored columns are calculated as follows: the middle of the grid is columns 2-3 (0-based in 6 columns). So original column x is mirrored to (5 - x). For example, column 0 \u21945, 1 \u21944, 2 \u21943.\n\nSo for Example 1's row B (row 2), elements are in columns 1 and 2. Their mirrored positions are 4 and 3. Reversed elements are 1 and 2. So placing 1 in mirrored columns 4 and 3? Wait, but mirrored columns of 1 and 2 are 4 and 3. But the reversed elements are 1 and 2. So the first element (1) is placed in mirrored columns (4 and 3), and the second element (2) in columns (1 and 0), but that doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are reversed and their columns are mirrored. For example, original elements in columns 1 and 2 (positions 1 and 2) are 2 and 1. Reversed to 1 and 2. Then mirrored columns would be 4 and 3. So placing 1 in columns 4 and 3, and 2 in columns 1 and 0. But in Example 1's output row 0, we have 1 in column 0 and 2 in columns 3 and 4. Which doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reversed pair is split into the left and right of the grid, but not mirrored. For example, the reversed pair's first element is placed in the leftmost two columns, and the second element in the rightmost two columns. Regardless of their original positions.\n\nIn Example 0's row B: reversed pair 8,7. 8 in left columns (0-1), 7 in right columns (4-5). \n\nExample 1's row B: reversed pair 1,2. 1 in left columns (0-1), 2 in right columns (4-5). But in the output, row 0 has 1 in column 0, then zeros, then 2 in columns 3-4. So perhaps it's allowed to have only the first column of the left and the first column of the right. But that's not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, the left and right placement uses two columns each, but the position depends on the available space. For example, in Example 1's row B reversed pair (1,2), place 1 in the left two columns (0-1) as [1,1], and 2 in the right two (4-5) as [2,2]. But in the output, row 0 has [1,0,0,2,2,0]. So 1 is in column 0, but column 1 is 0, and columns 4-5 are zeros, but columns 3-4 are 2,2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. Maybe the rule isn't about columns, but about the positions relative to the original. Another angle: in each example, the numbers in the top and bottom rows are derived from the middle rows' numbers. For example, the numbers in the output's top left are from the lower middle row's right number, and the top right from the lower middle row's left number, reversed. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the output is generated by taking the middle two rows, creating a 2x2 block, rotating it 180 degrees, and then expanding each number into a 2x2 block in the corners. \n\nFor Example 0's middle rows:\n\n9 3\n\n7 8\n\nRotated 180 degrees becomes:\n\n8 7\n\n3 9\n\nThen, expanding each into 2x2 blocks:\n\n8 8 in top left, 7 7 in top right, 3 3 in bottom left, 9 9 in bottom right. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2's middle rows:\n\n3 6\n\n5 2\n\nRotated 180 \u2192 2 5 then 6 3. Wait, no. Rotated 180 would swap elements and reverse each row. So original rows are:\n\nRow 2: 3,6\n\nRow 3:5,2\n\nRotating 180 degrees (like flipping vertically and horizontally):\n\nFirst reverse the order of rows: row 3 becomes first, row 2 becomes second.\n\nThen reverse each row's elements:\n\nRow 3 becomes 5,2 \u2192 reversed to 2,5\n\nRow 2 becomes 3,6 \u2192 reversed to 6,3\n\nSo the rotated block is:\n\n2,5\n\n6,3\n\nThen expanding each element into 2x2 blocks:\n\nTop left: 2,2; top right:5,5\n\nBottom left:6,6; bottom right:3,3. Which matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, Example 1's middle rows:\n\nRow 1:4,6\n\nRow 2:2,1\n\nRotate 180: reverse rows and reverse elements within each row. So:\n\nRow 2 becomes first: 2,1 \u2192 reversed to 1,2\n\nRow 1 becomes second:4,6 \u2192 reversed to 6,4\n\nSo rotated block:\n\n1,2\n\n6,4\n\nExpanding each into 2x2 blocks:\n\nTop left:1,1; top right:2,2\n\nBottom left:6,6; bottom right:4,4\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the bottom rows (4 and 5) have 6,6 on the left and 4,4 on the right. Which matches. The top rows would be 1,1 and 2,2. But in the output's first row (row 0) we have [1,0,0,2,2,0], which has 1 in column 0, and 2,2 starting at column 3. So perhaps the expansion is not exactly 2x2. Or maybe the rotation is applied, but the placement is in the top and bottom rows, with the middle rows remaining. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Take the 2x2 block from the two middle consecutive rows that contain non-zero elements.\n\n2. Rotate this block 180 degrees (flip vertically and horizontally).\n\n3. Expand each element of the rotated block into a 2x2 area in the four corners of the grid:\n\n   - Top-left corner (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) takes the top-left element of the rotated block, duplicated.\n\n   - Top-right corner (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) takes the top-right element, duplicated.\n\n   - Bottom-left corner (rows 4-5, columns 0-1) takes the bottom-left element, duplicated.\n\n   - Bottom-right corner (rows 4-5, columns 4-5) takes the bottom-right element, duplicated.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the rotated block is:\n\n1,2\n\n6,4\n\nSo top-left would be 1, duplicated into rows 0-1, columns 0-1. But in Example 1's output, row 0 is [1,0,0,2,2,0], which has 1 in column 0. Row 1 is [0,4,6,0,0,0]. So the top-left 2x2 area (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) is [1,0; 0,4]. Which doesn't fit. So perhaps this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rotated block is split into top and bottom parts, each placed in the top and bottom rows. For example, the top row of the rotated block is placed in the top two rows of the output, and the bottom row of the rotated block is placed in the bottom two rows. Each element is duplicated into two columns. \n\nIn Example 0's rotated block:\n\n8,7\n\n3,9\n\nTop row 8,7 is placed in rows 0-1. Each element is duplicated in two columns. So 8 in columns 0-1 and 7 in columns 4-5. \n\nBottom row 3,9 is placed in rows 4-5. 3 in columns 0-1, 9 in 4-5.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nIn Example 1's rotated block:\n\n1,2\n\n6,4\n\nTop row 1,2 \u2192 rows 0-1: 1 in columns 0-1 and 2 in columns 4-5. But in the output, row 0 has 1 in column 0, 2 in columns 3-4. So perhaps the columns are adjusted. Alternatively, maybe the rotated block's elements are placed in the left and right parts of the outer rows, but the columns are offset based on the original positions. \n\nAlternatively, the rotated block's elements are placed in the same column positions as the original, mirrored. For example, original elements are in columns 2-3. Mirrored to columns 0-1 and 4-5. \n\nIn Example 1, original non-zero elements are in columns 1-2 (for row 1) and 1-2 (for row 2). So mirrored to columns 4-3 and 4-3? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit too complicated, but let's try to apply the pattern to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRows 0-5:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe two consecutive middle rows with non-zero are rows 3 and 4 (indices 3 and 4). Their elements are:\n\nRow 3: [0,0,3,1,0,0] \u2192 non-zero elements 3,1.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,2,5,0,0] \u2192 non-zero elements 2,5.\n\nThe 2x2 block is:\n\n3,1\n\n2,5\n\nRotating 180 degrees (flip vertically and horizontally):\n\nFirst reverse the rows: row 4 comes first, then row 3.\n\nThen reverse each row's elements:\n\nRow 4 becomes 2,5 \u2192 reversed to 5,2.\n\nRow 3 becomes 3,1 \u2192 reversed to 1,3.\n\nSo the rotated block is:\n\n5,2\n\n1,3\n\nNow, expanding each element into their respective corners:\n\nTop-left (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) \u2192 5,5.\n\nTop-right (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) \u2192 2,2.\n\nBottom-left (rows 4-5, columns 0-1) \u21921,1.\n\nBottom-right (rows 4-5, columns 4-5) \u21923,3.\n\nBut wait, the original rows 3 and 4 are now part of the output's middle rows. So the output will have:\n\nRows 0-1: 5,5 followed by 2,2 in the top.\n\nRows 4-5: 1,1 and 3,3 in the bottom.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nWait, no. Wait, according to the pattern, the original middle rows (rows 3 and 4) remain unchanged. So the output's rows 3 and 4 are the same as input. But in the rotated block, the rotated rows are 5,2 and 1,3, which are placed in the top and bottom. So the top two rows (0-1) get 5,5 and 2,2. The bottom two rows (4-5) get 1,1 and 3,3. But row 4 in the input is part of the middle rows and is left unchanged. So this might not fit. \n\nWait, in the previous examples, the middle rows in the output were the same as the input's middle rows. For example, in Example 0, the middle rows (2 and 3) are unchanged. So in the test input, rows 3 and 4 are the middle rows and will be unchanged. So the output's rows 3 and 4 are [0,0,3,1,0,0] and [0,0,2,5,0,0]. Then the top rows 0-1 are filled with the rotated top elements (5 and 2), and the bottom rows 4-5 are filled with the rotated bottom elements (1 and 3). But row 4 is already part of the middle rows. Oh wait, no. The middle rows are rows 3 and 4 in the test input. So in the output, the rotated block's top row (5,2) is placed in the top rows (0-1), and the bottom row (1,3) is placed in the bottom rows (4-5). But row 4 is part of the original middle rows and should remain unchanged. This is a contradiction. \n\nAh, here's the problem: in the previous examples, the two middle rows were rows 2 and 3 (in a 6-row grid). So the rotated block's elements were placed in the top two and bottom two rows, leaving the middle rows intact. But in the test input, the middle rows are 3 and 4 (rows 3 and 4), which are lower down. So the rotated block's bottom row (1,3) needs to be placed in the bottom two rows (4-5), but row 4 is part of the original middle rows. This would conflict because row 4 in the output must remain as the original [0,0,2,5,0,0]. Therefore, the pattern must adjust placement based on the position of the middle rows. \n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to place the rotated elements in the first two and last two rows, regardless of where the original middle rows were. For example, in the test input's case, the rotated elements (5,2 and 1,3) are placed in rows 0-1 and 4-5, even though the middle rows are 3 and 4. But this would mean that row 4 in the output is overwritten. However, looking at Example 1, the middle rows were rows 1 and 2, and the output's row 4 and 5 were filled with the rotated bottom elements. So perhaps the pattern is that regardless of where the middle rows are, the rotated elements are placed in the top two and bottom two rows. \n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRotated block is:\n\n5,2\n\n1,3\n\nTop two rows (0-1) get 5,5 and 2,2.\n\nBottom two rows (4-5) get 1,1 and 3,3.\n\nBut the original row 4 is [0,0,2,5,0,0], which must remain unchanged. So there's a conflict here. \n\nThis suggests that my previous understanding of the pattern is incorrect. Let's re-examine the examples.\n\nLooking back at Example 1's input:\n\nMiddle rows are rows 1 and 2. The output's bottom rows (4-5) are filled with the rotated elements from row 1's data. But row 1 is part of the original middle rows, which are left unchanged. So in the output, the middle rows (1 and 2) are left as they are, and the rotated elements are placed in the top and bottom rows that are not part of the middle rows. \n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\n- The two middle rows (rows A and B) are left as-is.\n\n- The rotated block's first row is placed in the first two available rows above the middle rows.\n\n- The rotated block's second row is placed in the first two available rows below the middle rows.\n\nBut in Example 0, the middle rows are 2 and 3. The rotated block's first row (8,7) is placed in rows 0 and 1, which are above. The second row (3,9) is placed in rows 4 and 5, below. \n\nIn Example 1, middle rows are 1 and 2. Rotated first row (1,2) is placed in rows 0 and 1 (above). But row 1 is part of the middle rows. So this would overwrite row 1's data. But in Example 1's output, row 1 is unchanged. Therefore, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: the rotated block's first row is placed in the top two rows (0 and 1), regardless of the middle rows' position, and the second row in the bottom two rows (4 and 5). The middle rows remain as-is. \n\nThis seems to fit all examples:\n\nExample 0: rotated rows 8,7 and 3,9. Placed in rows 0-1 and 4-5. Middle rows 2-3 are unchanged.\n\nExample 1: rotated rows 1,2 and 6,4. Placed in rows 0-1 and 4-5. Middle rows 1-2 are unchanged.\n\nExample 2: rotated rows 2,5 and 6,3. Placed in rows 0-1 and 4-5. Middle rows 2-3 unchanged.\n\nTest input's rotated block is 5,2 and 1,3. Placed in rows 0-1 and 4-5. Middle rows 3-4 are unchanged. \n\nSo in the test input's output:\n\nRows 0-1: 5,5 and 2,2.\n\nRows 4-5: 1,1 and 3,3.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[5,5,0,0,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,5,0,0]\n\n[1,1,0,0,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the examples, each duplicated element occupies two consecutive columns. For example, in Example 0's top rows: 8,8 (columns 0-1) and 7,7 (columns 4-5). Similarly for the test input's output. So each element in the rotated block's row is duplicated in two columns. \n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nFor the test input, the rotated block after 180 degrees is:\n\n5,2\n\n1,3\n\nPlaced in rows 0-1 as [5,5,0,0,2,2] for both rows.\n\nAnd in rows 4-5 as [1,1,0,0,3,3] for both rows.\n\nMiddle rows (3 and 4) remain as-is.",
